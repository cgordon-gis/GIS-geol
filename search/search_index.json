GIS for geologists is a brief introduction to the use of GIS and spatial data for students on the geology programme at the University of Leeds. The aim is to give a broad overview of how GIS can be used to explore, analyse and display geological data. Course topics The sections in this course build on each other and should be worked through in order. Cross-references to skills learnt in earlier sections will be included, and you can use the search box to find specific terms. Week Section Skills 1 Introduction to GIS Exploring ArcGIS Pro and the data 2 Finding data How to find data online Instruction formats These web pages will be kept updated as the course progresses. If you would prefer a version for printing please download the Word or pdf version. Note that these may not be quite as up to date. If you need the instructions in a different format please contact Clare. Contact details are in Minerva for my students. Note This is a note - not as fancy as the previous one, but more possible to export to Word etc. What happens if this is more than one line? I can add more text and see what happens. Warning Look out! Bad things could happen if you do this\u2026 Video clip Have a look at this exciting video! Information or tip This can contain useful information, e.g. how to unzip files\u2026","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-gis-for-geologists-2020","text":"Warning Note that at the moment these pages contain trial formatting, ideas etc rather than actual instructions.

The lecture segment should help you to understand why you are doing these exercises. If you still aren\u2019t sure, please ask Clare. Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you will be able to demonstrate how to open a map project in ArcGIS select appropriate tools to navigate in a map document use layers to organise and display information on a map add information to a layout and prepare it for printing or display demonstrate different ways of finding help when using GIS Introduction to the exercises As a GIS specialist you have been asked by the Field Studies Council to produce a geological map of the area around the Malham Tarn National Nature Reserve (NNR). For this first exercise I have created a basic geological map of Malham Tarn so that you can explore the GIS application and get used to basic navigation and functions. In future sessions you will be preparing the data and setting up the basics for yourself. Obtaining and opening the sample map The sample map is based on British Geological Survey data covering Malham Tarn in North Yorkshire and uses data from a number of sources with which you will become familiar during this module.

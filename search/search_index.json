The lecture segment should help you to understand why you are doing these exercises. If you still aren\u2019t sure, please ask Clare . Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to describe the main types of data used in GIS use the tools provided in ArcGIS Pro to prepare data for further use find out essential information about the data and apply that to your use of the data in ArcGIS Introduction In this chapter you will be creating a map from scratch using the data that you downloaded in the previous chapter. You will create a 1:10 000 topographic base map that is suitable to use as a fieldslip for geological field mapping, and later as a basis for digitising geological data. By creating this map you will also learn how to find out more about your data and how to use the tools available to process it before adding it to your map. Obtaining the data If you have followed the sections on Digimap and Natural Earth data in the previous chapter you should have downloaded and kept examples of the following data Digimap VectorMap Local Raster OS Terrain 5 Contours Natural Earth Countries Shaded relief and water If you haven\u2019t downloaded those, or have but can\u2019t find them, then please return to the instructions and download them now, then come back here. You should have set up a folder called gis when you worked through the introduction . If not, go back and follow those instructions now. Create a new folder called FindingData in the gis folder on your disk Copy or save all of the data you have downloaded into this folder Unzip all of the zip files, again, into this folder. You should end up with a folder structure something like the image below. Keeping all of your data in the same project folder as the rest of your map data means that it is much easier to find it and you can keep a copy of the whole project as a backup so that you don\u2019t lose data. Starting a new map project In the previous chapters you used an ArcGIS project that I had set up for you. This time you need to set up your own project from scratch. Open ArcGIS Pro by going to the Start Menu and searching for it. Make sure that you have ArcGIS Pro, not any other version of Arc or ArcGIS and open that program When the ArcGIS Pro splash screen opens select to open New > Blank Templates > Map You\u2019ll get a form to fill in with the project details. for Name fill in FindingData - the same as the folder you\u2019ve just put your data in for Location browse to the FindingData folder, enter it, then click OK Untick the box next to Create a new folder for this project Click OK Doing it this way ensures that you are keeping your data in the project folder, which will help you to find it later. ArcGIS should open a new map with a view of the World. This is the default ESRI basemap and is a general layer which is useful as it gives you some idea of where you are when you zoom in. The section on Using basemaps in the first chapter of this workbook shows you how to select alternative basemaps. In the Catalog pane you should see several new files and folders appear in the folder in which you have created the project, for example, FindingData.gdb ; ImportLog ; FindingData.aprx . Now go to the Folders subheading in the Catalog and drop down the list of contents. You should be able to see the folders containing your data, plus some items that ArcGIS Pro has added by default. If you open up the folders you should be able to see the data too. If you can\u2019t and you are sure that you put your data in that folder, make sure that everything is unzipped. Adding downloaded data to your map One thing to remember when adding data to a map is that the first layer that you add sets the spatial reference , or coordinate system for that map. When downloading data from Digimap the raster layers don\u2019t always have coordinate system information, so it makes sense to start by adding the vector layers. Start by having a look at your data so that you know more about it. You are going to be creating a map with the spatial reference of British National Grid so need to check whether all of the layers are set to that. In the Catalog pane, look for each of the datasets that you downloaded in turn right-click on the data file - which in this case will either have an extension of .tif or .shp go to Properties and have a look at the information under the subheadings there. Make a note for yourself of the following properties for each dataset is the data vector or raster? what is the data type? what is the Projected Coordinate system? what is the Geographic Coordinate system? Remember that the lecture segment for this practical covered the differences between vector and raster file formats. If you are still unsure please go back and have another look at the presentation on that. Your notes should show something like the following - Data Vector or raster? Data type? Projected coordinate system? Geographic coordinate system? OS Terrain 5 contours vector Shapefile feature class British National Grid GCS OSGB 1936 OS VectorMap Local raster raster File system raster British National Grid GCS OSGB 1936 Natural Earth shaded relief and water raster File system raster none GCS WGS 1984 Natural Earth Countries vector Shapefile feature class none GCS WGS 1984 Adding vector data Now that you have decided which layers are vector, and which have the correct coordinate system for your final map, you can start to think about adding the data to your map. We\u2019ll start with the OS Terrain 5 contours because they are a vector layer and have the projected coordinate system British National Grid, which is what we want our map to be in. Merging contour shapefiles The next thing to check is how many separate shapefiles have you downloaded for this area? In the Catalog find the folder containing the Terrain 5 contour layers and drop down so that you can see the contents you\u2019ll need to drop down the subfolders too, until you can see something like the image below You should find that you have multiple files, some of which have point as part of the name, some of which have line as part of the name, and a few files with an extension of .xml . You can ignore the point files and the xml files. How many line shapefiles do you have? In my folder, shown above, I have four line shapefiles. Try adding these files to your map by dragging and dropping them into the top of the Contents. You can select multiple files to add by holding down the Ctrl key and clicking on each of them. You should find that you have something like the image below (though with a different number of tiles). You have contour lines, but Arc has assigned a different colour to each tile. At the moment the shapefiles are still four separate files, and if you styled them you would have to style each one in turn. It makes sense to combine, or merge these files into one. If you only have one tile of contour data you don\u2019t need to merge it, but you should have a minimum of two for this exercise. Remove the contour files from your map Creating a base map with OS data: 1. Merging contour shapefiles This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . From the Analysis tab of the ribbon find Merge in the Tools group OR go to the Analysis tab of the ribbon, click on Tools to open the toolbox panel on the right, then Toolboxes > Data Management Tools > General > Merge Add all line contour shapefile tiles as the input by clicking on the folder icon to the right You may need to include files from more than one sub-folder. Remember that you only need to add the line shapefiles, not the point . to add more than one tile at a time use the Ctrl key and then click on each file Save the output to the project geodatabase, that is the file with the same name as your project and an extension of .gdb , and give the output feature class a name such as contours that will help you to identify it again later leave the rest of the fields as the defaults Run - Arc should merge your shapefiles, add them to the geodatabase and then zoom in and display them on your map If Arc doesn\u2019t take you to the correct location for your data, remember that you can Zoom to Layer by right-clicking on the contours layer in the Contents and selecting Zoom to Layer from the context menu. You should end up with something like the image below with a random choice of a single colour for all of your contours. The ESRI basemap layer still shows behind the contours. If you need to save disk space, or even just want to tidy up your data, you can now delete the folder containing the original contour data. If you need it again you can either unzip the file that you downloaded from Digimap, or just redo the download. Checking the coordinate system of your map Now that you have added your first layer it is a good idea to check that the coordinate system of your map is correct. Remember that we are creating a map which should be in British National Grid . In the Contents pane right-click on the Map title at the top of the list select Properties from the context menu go to the Coordinate Systems subheading and check the Current XY The Current XY should be British National Grid - but if it isn\u2019t don\u2019t panic. Look in the box below which shows XY Coordinate Systems Available Find your contours layer and click on it and the Current XY entry should change to match it. Once you have the correct coordinate system click OK If your contours are set correctly, the Current XY should change to British National Grid to match. If this doesn\u2019t work, or you don\u2019t have a layer in British National Grid try the following Above the XY Coordinate Systems Available box in the search box type British National Grid and press return You should see that in an opened out list under Projected coordinate system - click on the entry for British National Grid Once you have the correct coordinate system click OK Adding raster data Now we\u2019ll move on to the VectorMap Local raster data. The name rather gives it away for this one, but this is a raster format. If you remember, back in the Digimap section, you opened this file to have a look at it. It should have opened in an image editor, and is basically a picture of a map. You\u2019ll be using this as a detailed background layer for your map as it should show more information than the ESRI basemap layer. Because of this, if you have more than one tile of data you don\u2019t need to merge them. You can just add multiple files to the map and they will still show as the background. Other raster data layers contain data, rather than being a picture. You can add them in the same way, but they will serve a different purpose. You\u2019ll investigate these sorts of layers later in the course. Creating a base map with OS data: 2. adding raster background maps This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . To add the raster tiles Find the file or files 1 in the Folders subheading of the Catalog Pane. The background files from Digimap should be under a folder called something like vml-raster-bwr and have names like vml-raster...tif then simply drag and drop the raster file(s) from the Catalog pane to the Contents pane so that they are placed below the contour layer, but above the ESRI background layer. Don\u2019t forget that you may have files in more than one folder If you are offered the choice of creating Pyramids say Yes 2 Your raster maps may appear rather bad quality, this is usually just an onscreen problem. When you print your map, or zoom in close, it should be fine. Check that the VectorMap Local raster background map looks right with your contours, e.g. that the contours don\u2019t go straight through the middle of lakes, or that streams don\u2019t appear to flow uphill. If you have a clipped layer the background map may well not cover the same area as the contours - don\u2019t worry about that. If you think the black and white background is too dark/strong you can always fade it a bit by using Transparency Removing the ESRI background layers This is a good point at which to remove the ESRI base map layers, e.g. World Topographic Map and World Hillshade, so that they don\u2019t cause problems later. Right-click on each of the basemap layers in turn in the Contents Remove Set the scale of your map to 1:10 000. Your map should look something like the image below, though probably with the contours a different colour. Symbolising the data on your map Symbolising is the word that ESRI use for the process of making your data look good - this could also be described as styling. Your map now shows the required data, but doesn\u2019t quite look right. The VectorMap Local raster data is fine - that is already styled and there isn\u2019t anything else you need to do with it. The contours also need to be changed to grey, and they are rather thick. They also need to have labels added showing the height. Setting the reference scale Before you start symbolising and labelling your layers it is a good idea to set the reference scale to the scale at which you are intending to print the map. In this case you are putting together a fieldslip and you are most likely to need to print it at either 1:10 000 or 1:5 000. Setting the reference scale will ensure that when you choose styles or the label size they will look the same as they will once your map is printed. Start by setting the scale of your map to 1:10 000, using the dropdown below the map view In the Contents pane right-click on the title of your map - usually Map Click to Set Reference Scale and it\u2019s done You can reset the reference scale just by going to a different scale and doing the same, or you can clear the reference scale completely if you wish to. Styling the contours Now that the contour lines are in your project you need to symbolise them so that they look professional. For this take inspiration from the British Geological Survey published maps 3 . Symbolising a layer by unique values in Arc This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . Select your contours layer in the contents pane then click on the Appearance tab of the ribbon and click on the Symbology button to open the Symbology pane to the right of your map. Symbolising as unique values It is good practice to symbolise your contours so that most are of a standard width, but contours at a regular interval are made slightly thicker. This makes it easier to interpret the heights. Check the attribute table for your contour feature class (right-click on the layer in the contents pane and select Attribute table . For Ordnance Survey contour data there will be a column which divides the contours into master and ordinary . If your area is on the coast you may also have high and low water mark. What is the name of the column that divides the contours into master and ordinary? Make a note of the column name, you\u2019ll need that for setting the symbology. In the symbology pane change the dropdown under Primary Symbology to Unique Values Dropdown the box next to Field1 and change it to the column that you made a note of above Arc should automatically classify your data as the number of different sub-types in your feature class and give them a random colour. You will also end up with a value labelled all other values . You don\u2019t need it for this map so the next step shows you how to get rid of this. To get rid of all other values - on the Classes tab click on the More button which has a little down arrow Untick Show all other values You shouldn\u2019t notice any difference on your map, but it will tidy up your contents pane, and if you were going to add this layer to a map legend it would stop it showing there too. Styling the contour lines Back in the first chapter you styled the layers on the Malham map . This is a similar process so it should seem familiar. The automatic / default styling of the contour lines is unlikely to be satisfactory. To style the two different types of line Click on the symbol to the left of one of the line types on the Classes tab Check that you are on the Properties tab of the next panel, not the Gallery Change the colour and line width as suggested below - you can play around with the settings later when you see what they look like on the map Go back to the symbology pane between each value so that you symbolise both the master and the ordinary contours For a black and white or greyscale map Color = Grey 40% Line width Master / index contour = 0.8 pt Standard / ordinary contour = 0.4 pt Click Apply For a faded colour map Color = Seville Orange (hover over the colour patches to see their names!) Line width Master / index contour = 0.8 pt Standard / ordinary contour = 0.4 pt Click Apply Labelling the contours It is essential to add labels to the contour lines to show the height. Without labels contour lines are basically worthless. How to add labels to layers in Arc This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . Have a look at the attribute table of the contours feature class again. What is the name of the column which holds the information about height above sea-level? Again, make a note of this, you\u2019ll need it for labelling the contours. To label the contours Select the contour layer in the contents panel Click on the Labeling tab of the ribbon then click on the Label button at the far left of the ribbon Labels will appear on your map, but they are unlikely to be the labels that you actually need. To change the content of the labels In the Label Class group of the labeling tab use the Field dropdown to select the field that you made a note of above - the one which holds the information about the height of the contour The labels should change to the height. But if you have a closer look at the contours you should notice that the labels don\u2019t actually appear on top of the lines to which they refer. You need to change the Label Placement . In the Label Placement group of the labeling ribbon use the arrow on the right to find the Contours setting. If you click on the little arrow in the bottom right corner of the group you should open the Position tab of the Label Class pane Drop down the Placement subheading and you should be able to check the settings there The contour placement should set your labels so that they are on top of the lines and curved, which is how contour labels appear on Ordnance Survey maps. Now you need to change how the text looks. Click on the Symbol tab of the Label Class dialog Drop down the Appearance subheading From there you\u2019ll most likely need to set a smaller font size, e.g. 8 pt, and change the colour of the text symbol to match the colour of the contours Once you\u2019ve changed the settings click Apply to see what they look like. You may need to wait a bit while Arc applies them - labelling contours can slow things down rather. You can try out alternatives to see what looks best. Remember that the contours and their labels need to be present and visible so that they can be used in map reading, but not so large that they dominate the map. If in doubt, check OS or BGS published maps as suggested at the start of this section. Creating a layout for printing You will need to add various map elements to a layout for your field slip. You will work through a whole chapter on Layout and Presentation later in this module, but for now you\u2019ll do a quick version. Go to the Insert ribbon and click on New Layout Select ISO - Portrait > A4 On the ribbon click on the arrow under Map Frame and select your map Now click on the page and draw out a \u201cbox\u201d - don\u2019t worry too much about the area/size for now At the bottom of the screen change the scale to 1:10 000 to zoom in to your map With the map still selected click on Grid on the ribbon then select Measured Grid > Black Vertical Label Grid to add grid references around the outside of your map Click on Scale Bar in the Map Surrounds group and select any of the Metric scale bars Use the text tools to add the following copyright text for the Ordnance Survey data that you have used \u00a9 Crown copyright and database rights 2020. Ordnance Survey (100025252) You can play with the settings for the elements you have added, but we will be looking at layout and presentation in more detail later. Your final field slip map should look something like the map below: If, when you downloaded the data from Digimap, you selected to Clip the data you will probably only have one tile or file of data. If you selected not to clip, you will probably have multiple tiles or files. \u21a9 Pyramids take a moment to create when you first load the file, but make it much quicker to move around in your map once they are loaded. \u21a9 You can see the scanned geological maps online on the BGS website. Try to make sure that you look at a recently published example such as the 1:25 000 Ardnamurchan Central Complex map published in 2009.

It should have opened in an image editor, and is basically a picture of a map. You\u2019ll be using this as a detailed background layer for your map as it should show more information than the ESRI basemap layer. Because of this, if you have more than one tile of data you don\u2019t need to merge them. You can just add multiple files to the map and they will still show as the background. Other raster data layers contain data, rather than being a picture. You can add them in the same way, but they will serve a different purpose.

In this set of exercises you will produce a map of Chancellors Court in the University showing the outlines of the buildings, the paths, and any other features such as seats and signposts. Even if you don\u2019t actually need to digitise a map it is extremely useful to know how to set up your own feature classes and how to add features by editing. Sometimes you just need to outline your study area, or add a point to show where something specific is, or as input to one of the tools provided in Arc. This is a very brief overview of the tools for digitising in Arc as we are limited for time. If you need to do anything more complex then you should be able to find plenty more information in the ArcGIS Pro Help . If you are a Geology student you will be getting more information in level two as part of your preparation to produce your dissertation map in ArcGIS Pro. Vector and raster If you feel that you are still not clear about the difference between raster and vector GIS data it would be worth having a look at the video \u201c Learn more about raster and vector map data \u201d by the Ordnance Survey. As you deal with more GIS data you\u2019ll start to find it easier to spot which formats are raster and which are vector, but you need to be thinking about it already. Obtaining the background data You will need to download the DigitiseData.zip file from Minerva unzip the file to your GIS working folder You should have a folder containing data and an ArcGIS project file. Open the .aprx file in ArcGIS Pro by double-clicking on it when it finishes opening check that the links in the contents pane are not broken - if you have red exclamation marks next to any layer you need to repair the links following the instructions below. Once your file is open and any broken links are repaired you should be able to see an aerial view of the University which uses aerial data from Digimap. Repairing broken file links If you find that your map doesn\u2019t show and that you have the red exclamation marks next to the data as in the image below (note that this isn\u2019t the same map project that you are using), follow these instructions to repair the data links. If you use absolute file paths and you have to move the files from one location to another, or if you have a project folder set up by someone else, you may find that the broken links are marked by a red exclamation mark next to the layer name. This can also happen if you are adding .lyr files for symbology. Repairing broken file links This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . To check the name of the file that you\u2019ll need to locate: Open the layer properties and go to the Source tab Under Data Source you will see which file Arc is looking for - make a note of this Look through your file system to find the correct file Once you know where the file you need is located, do the following to repair the link: from the layer properties source tab Set Data Source... Navigate to the file that you need then OK > OK That layer should now appear on your map. If you\u2019re lucky all of the missing layers will appear, but if you\u2019re not you\u2019ll need to repeat the process for each layer. Preparing to digitise data The first thing you need to do when preparing to digitise is to set up the storage for your data. When the project was set up Arc automatically included a geodatabase within it. The geodatabase is the overall container for your data and will store feature datasets and feature classes . You\u2019ve already worked with feature classes in previous chapters. These are vector layers which can hold points, lines or polygons. A feature dataset can contain a range of related feature classes. The image below shows what your Catalog will look like when it is fully set up (note that the geodatabase name may be different - that doesn\u2019t matter. Set up a feature dataset within a geodatabase To set up the geodatabase contents - In the Catalog pane go to the Databases subheading and open it out. There will be a geodatabase with the same name as the project / folder. Right-click on your geodatabase New > Feature Dataset Enter a name that describes the information that it will contain, in this example it could be University Set your projection - in this case it should be British National Grid so select Projected Coordinate Systems > National Grids > Europe > British National Grid Click Run Set up a feature class Still in the Catalog pane Right-click on the feature dataset that you\u2019ve just set up (in this example the one called University ) New > Feature Class Fill in the geoprocessing dialog that opens as shown below give your feature class a name that explains what it shows, with no spaces or punctuation, e.g. in this case Buildings the Feature Class Alias is the name that will appear in the contents pane - this can include spaces Choose the correct Geometry Type - it\u2019s important to get this right as it isn\u2019t possible to change this once you\u2019ve created the feature class. For the buildings layer select Polygon If you are storing the feature class in a dataset which already has a spatial reference set you shouldn\u2019t need to fill that in again If you click on Next you\u2019ll get an opportunity to add fields and other information, but don\u2019t worry about this for now Click Finish to create the new feature class The feature class should be added to your feature dataset, and also added to the contents pane of the map that is open. If it isn\u2019t automatically added to the contents pane just drag and drop it across. Setting up further feature classes In the same way, inside the feature dataset, create a feature class called Paths with a feature type of Line Also create a feature class called Trees with a feature type of Point Note that if you forget to change the feature type when you are creating a feature class it can\u2019t be changed later. All you can do is use the Catalog to delete the feature class and create a new one. Arc should automatically add the new feature classes to your table of contents. If it hasn\u2019t, add them now. Your ArcGIS Window should now look something like the image below. Digitising in ArcGIS Pro You should already have an aerial view as a background for your map. For these exercises you\u2019ll be digitising polygons, points and lines by tracing over features on this view. Starting to digitise - polygons Digitising in Arc Part 1: Starting and finishing, and creating polygon features This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . To start editing simply click on the Edit tab of the ribbon Click on the Create button in the Features group A Create Features pane should open on the right-hand side of the window and this should show the editable layers in your map. Click on the Buildings layer in the Create Features pane and select the Polygons tool - the one on the left. As usual, if you hover over icons you\u2019ll get a tooltip. Now you\u2019re ready to start adding a feature. We\u2019ll start by digitising the School of Earth and Environment (SEE). So start by zooming in to the building. I realise you may not actually have seen the School of Earth and Environment by this point. To find it use the Go To XY tool from the Map tab of the ribbon. When you click on the Go To XY button a small panel will open at the bottom of the map screen. You may need to change the final box on the tool so that it reads Meter . Once you\u2019ve done that you should be able to enter the grid reference for Chancellors Court which is: 429375 434402 Now click on the hand symbol at the end of the tool to pan to Chancellors Court. The School of Earth and Environment is the building along the northern side of Chancellors Court and the building just to the north of it. Now you know where the building is, zoom in to it To create a polygon left-click along the edges of the building. Each click creates a Vertex , or corner. To finish a polygon double-click on the last point or press the F2 key on the keyboard. The polygon should be outlined by the selection colour, e.g. turquoise, once you\u2019ve done this. You can continue straight on to digitise another building if you wish to, but remember to save your edits regularly - see the next point Saving your edits You need to remember to save the features that you\u2019ve digitised at regular intervals. This is also described as saving your edits. To save your edits click Save on the Edit tab of the ribbon. If you don\u2019t want to save your edits click Discard instead. Remember to save your edits It is important to remember to save your edits on the Edit toolbar - they are not being stored in the map, but are being written to the external feature class that you have set up. If you close Arc without saving the edits, even if you save the map, they won\u2019t be there next time you open it. Transparency Don\u2019t forget that you can make layers transparent . As you draw your building polygons you\u2019ll gradually be covering up the layers underneath and it can be useful to see through the top layers. Continue to digitise Continue to digitise buildings so that you have polygons for all of the buildings around Chancellors Court (the open space south of Earth and Environment). Remember to save all of your new polygons. Stopping a digitising session Once you\u2019ve finished adding items it isn\u2019t obvious how to stop! Click on the Map tab of the ribbon Click on the Explore button from the Navigate group If you don\u2019t do this you tend to find that you\u2019re adding new features by mistake - which is rather irritating! Potential issues with the data Stop and think about the digitising that you have just done. Can you think of any potential issues with the data that you have created in this way? Make some notes for yourself on the issues that you identify. Use the questions below as a starting point. What scale did you digitise at? What effect will this have on the amount of detail that you included? What recommendation would you make about viewing the data on a map? How accurate were you when you were placing the vertices (by clicking on the map)? How did you decide where to put the features? How clear were the edges of the building that you were digitising? What did you do when there were trees overlapping other features? What about shadows? Did they make it hard to see building edges? Think how this might affect data that you have obtained from other people. How might they have solved the same problems? Modifying features Once you\u2019ve created a feature you may need to edit it, either to move it or to reshape it. Digitising in Arc Part 4: Editing features after creation. This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . Watch Digitising in Arc Part 1 for general information about digitising. On the ribbon go to the Edit tab and click on the Modify This should open the Modify Features pane on the right of the map window Use the Select tool from the Edit tab of the ribbon to click on the feature that you want to modify so that the feature is outlined in turquoise to show that it is selected. On the Modify Features pane click on Vertices . The outline of the feature on the map should change - see the image below. The vertices will be marked as small boxes - the red one shows the start/end and the green ones are the intermediate vertices. Controlling selections If you have overlapping layers it can be difficult to select just the feature that you want, either to find the details for it, or to edit it. When you click on your map to select a feature it is possible to select the correct one from the little dialog which pops up. This isn\u2019t always convenient, though, particularly if you need to do a lot of selecting items. It can be useful to prevent other layers from being selectable as if more than one feature is selected you won\u2019t be able to make the changes. Selection tools and stopping layers from being selectable This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . To control which layers can be selected from, and which can\u2019t, try the following: From the top of the Contents pane click on the List by Selection button - remember the tool tips appear if you hover over the buttons In the view of your layers which appears ensure that the layer or layers that you want to be able to select from are ticked - in this case check that Buildings, Paths and Trees are ticked the layer or layers that you don\u2019t want to be able to select from are not ticked. It\u2019s a good idea to go straight back to the List By Drawing Order view of your layers or it\u2019s easy to get confused later Modifying features (continued) Once you have the feature selected with the Vertices tool it is now a case of using the mouse cursor to move the edges or corners of the feature use the vertices editing on the building outline that you\u2019ve just created to move some of the vertices - it doesn\u2019t matter in this case if the outline isn\u2019t quite right, you\u2019re just practicing! to remove a vertex (corner) just right-click on it and select Delete Vertex from the menu To add a vertex (corner) right-click on one of the edges and select Add Vertex from the menu Once you\u2019re happy with the shape finish editing by pressing the F2 key, then Save using the button on the Edit ribbon. Modify features pane Try some of the other tools on the Modify Features pane. In particular try Move, Rotate and Scale from the Alignment section. Once you\u2019ve finished trying out the tools delete any polygons which don\u2019t match the buildings around Chancellors Court and redraw them in the correct place. Adding more information to a feature class Next you\u2019ll add some extra information to your new features. It would be useful to be able to label the buildings with their names, so we\u2019ll have to add another field to the Buildings feature class so that we can add Feature attributes . Adding new fields to a feature class Right-click on the Buildings layer in the Contents pane and open the Attribute Table To add a new field click on the Add button on the attribute table toolbar The attribute table will change to Field view - showing more information about the data types and formats Fill in the details in the new field (which will appear at the bottom of the list) to create a new field called Name The Field Name should be short and contain no spaces or strange characters Alias is how the name will be displayed and can include spaces - it\u2019s still a good idea to keep it short Set the Data Type to Text Set the Length to 120 - that\u2019s the maximum number of characters you\u2019ll be able to use in a name Once you\u2019ve filled in that click on the Save button on the ribbon You can add more fields in this view if you want to, but for now close the Fields tab and return to the Buildings attribute table. Adding attributes to a field The first thing you need to do is work out which row in the attribute table belongs to which feature on the map. The easiest way is to select a row in the attribute table and see which feature shows as selected on the map. Once you know which feature you are entering the name for, double-click in the space under Building name and type in the name. See the image below for the names of the buildings around Chancellors Court and enter them all in your attribute table. Once again, don\u2019t forget to Save your edits frequently by clicking on the button on the Edit tab of the ribbon When you\u2019ve finished adding names to each building and have saved them, just close the attribute table. Labelling features on the map Now that you have label text in your attribute table you can label the features on your map. How to add labels to layers in Arc This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . In the Contents pane select the layer that you want to label - in this case the Buildings layer On the ribbon click the Labelling tab, then click on the Label button on the left-hand side Check that Label Features in this Class is ticked, then use the dropdown next to Field to select the field in which you entered your building names. The labels should appear on top of the features to which they apply and should look something like the image above, with the names visible. You can try out some of the options in the Text Symbol and Label Placement groups on the ribbon to see what they look like. Remember that this is an opportunity to experiment, because it really doesn\u2019t matter what the end result looks like! Labelling options Try changing the font of your labels and maybe making them larger. What effect do the options under Label Placement have? Do any of them look better to you than the default? Digitsing line features Digitising line features is very similar to digitising polygons, except that you don\u2019t have to \u201cclose\u201d a line. Digitising in Arc Part 2: Creating line features This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . Watch Digitising in Arc Part 1 for general information about digitising. You should already have the Paths layer added to your map, if you haven\u2019t add it now. Digitise lines Follow the instructions given for digitising buildings , but this time trace the paths across Chancellors Court into the Paths feature class. Don\u2019t forget to save your edits when you\u2019ve finished. You don\u2019t need to add any labels for the lines layers in this case, but if you did it all works in exactly the same way as it did for the buildings. Potential issues with the data Again, stop and think about the digitising that you have just done. Can you think of any potential issues with the data that you have created in this way? Make some notes for yourself on the issues that you identify. Use the questions below as a starting point. What scale did you digitise at? What effect will this have on the amount of detail that you included? What recommendation would you make about viewing the data on a map? How accurate were you when you were placing the vertices (by clicking on the map)? How easy is it to be accurate with the tools? How did you decide where to put the features? Did you decide to draw the edges of the paths or the centre line? How can you be sure of what happens underneath trees or buildings? Think how this might affect data that you have obtained from other people. How might they have solved the same problems? Digitising point features Again, digitising point features is very similar to digitising lines and polygons, except that you only have to click once for each feature. Digitising in Arc Part 3: Creating point features This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . Watch Digitising in Arc Part 1 for general information about digitising. You should already have the Trees layer added to your map, if you haven\u2019t add it now. Digitise points Follow the instructions given for digitising buildings , but this time place a single point for each tree you can see in Chancellors Court into the Trees feature class. Don\u2019t forget to save your edits when you\u2019ve finished. You don\u2019t need to add any labels for the points layer in this case, but if you did it all works in exactly the same way as it did for the buildings. Potential issues with the data Again, stop and think about the digitising that you have just done. Can you think of any potential issues with the data that you have created in this way? Make some notes for yourself on the issues that you identify. Use the questions below as a starting point. How easy is it to decide where you should add a point to represent a tree? How easy is it to be accurate with the drawing tools? Think how this might affect data that you have obtained from other people. How might they have solved the same problems? Symbolising your data In other words, styling it, or making it look better. Changing the colour of any of the features on your map is simple - Select a layer in the contents pane, e.g. the buildings Click on the Appearance tab of the ribbon, and then on Symbology This should open the symbology pane on the right of the window Click on the symbol to change it\u2019s colour, either via the Gallery for presets, or via Properties to set your own. Try this with the paths and trees too. You may not have a tree-like symbol available in ArcGIS Pro, don\u2019t worry about this for now. You\u2019ll find out how to add more choices to the Gallery in a future class. Finally\u2026 Check that you\u2019ve finished digitising the buildings around Chancellors Court and the paths across it. Check that all of the layers you have created - the points, lines and polygons, have all been symbolised appropriately and are labelled where necessary. Once you\u2019ve turned off the background imagery layer, and the ESRI base map layer, your data could look something like the map below.

In this set of exercises you will produce a map of Chancellors Court in the University showing the outlines of the buildings, the paths, and any other features such as seats and signposts. Even if you don\u2019t actually need to digitise a map it is extremely useful to know how to set up your own feature classes and how to add features by editing. Sometimes you just need to outline your study area, or add a point to show where something specific is, or as input to one of the tools provided in Arc. This is a very brief overview of the tools for digitising in Arc as we are limited for time. If you need to do anything more complex then you should be able to find plenty more information in the ArcGIS Pro Help . If you are a Geology student you will be getting more information in level two as part of your preparation to produce your dissertation map in ArcGIS Pro.

Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to demonstrate that you can find suitable data for GIS projects from a variety of sources acknowledge the data that you use in your maps in a suitable fashion Introduction Being able to find, download and prepare your own data is an essential part of using GIS. While the data will be provided for you for many of the exercises in this module, you will find it useful to have some idea of where the data comes from, and what there is available for you to use for your own maps. While downloading shouldn\u2019t take too long, don\u2019t leave it until the last minute before you have to produce a map. Websites can become unavailable either permanently or temporarily, or computers can crash. Digimap Digimap is a service provided to Higher Education in the U.K. by EDINA at Edinburgh University. Digimap provides a front end to digital maps and data of Great Britain from the Ordnance Survey and British Geological Survey, amongst others. The University of Leeds subscribes to the collections and as a student you have access to maps and data for use as part of your studies. Logging in to Digimap If you have not used Digimap before you will need to register and log in using your University ID, that is the username and password that you use to access University systems such as Minerva. Full instructions for logging in are on the Digimap help pages . Go to the Digimap Collections page at https://digimap.edina.ac.uk Click the Log in button at the top right of the screen type Leeds in the box and select University of Leeds from the list of available institutions You should get the familiar University of Leeds log in page, so type your University username and password into the appropriate boxes and then click the Log in button. If you are already logged in to Minerva you may find that you don\u2019t have to enter your login details again. If this is the first time that you\u2019ve logged in to Digimap you\u2019ll be asked to register for each collection separately, though you can do all at one go. You won\u2019t need to use all of the collections during this module, but it\u2019s worth registering for all that are available to you so that you can explore them for yourself. The University does not subscribe to Marine or Global Digimap. Go through the list of collections, read and accept the conditions for each one, selecting Academic Works (coursework, projects, dissertations etc.) in the Purpose dropdown for each. Once you submit all of those you should be taken to the Digimap initial page again, as shown below, but this time you should see your name at top right rather than the log in button. The list includes options for a large number of collections. In this workbook we\u2019ll only be looking at the collections that are the most relevant for creating the maps you\u2019ll need during your course, but if you are interested in any of the others feel free to explore them. EDINA have worked to make all of the tools similar across each collection, so just have a go! Browsing maps on screen Each Digimap collection provides a Roam and a Download interface. The Roam interface allows you to view the data from that collection on a map on screen. Using Digimap OS Roam As an example click on Ordnance Survey on the menu at the top of the main screen Then select Roam under View, annotate & print a map on the right. Have a go at zooming in and out and exploring the map at different scales. Try searching for a location in the Search box at the top left. In this module we\u2019ll be making most use of the Download interface, but it\u2019s worth knowing what the Roam interface will do too, so have a quick go with a few of the tools on the left before continuing with the next exercise. If you want more information about using the Roam interface have a look at the Digimap Resource Centre which is linked from Resources on the main page. Downloading data from Digimap Data Download is the tool for downloading data for use in GIS or CAD software. The format that the data is delivered in will determine whether you will be able to open it directly in a software package or whether you will need to convert it. We\u2019ll be using data from Digimap in ArcGIS for various exercises in the rest of this module, so you need to know your way around this section. Instructions for converting, importing and viewing file types that need it will be given later in the workbook. As an example of the download interface we\u2019ll download some Ordnance Survey data. Start from the Digimap main page click on Ordnance Survey in the menu at the top of the page from the Ordnance Survey page choose Data Download Data Download takes you to a map that looks very similar to Digimap Roam, but with some important differences. Selecting an area On the left there is a menu panel with options for selecting an area, with a search box above it. Click in the Search box and type Otley , then press Enter or click on the magnifying glass to search When you get the results click on Otley (Leeds) to zoom in, then close the search results Under Draw click on the rectangle and use the mouse to draw a box around the area shown by an orange box in the image below, clicking to start and finish the box. Area view Note that the map you see on the screen only shows the area that you will be downloading data for, not the actual data that you\u2019ll be downloading. You\u2019ll select the data in the next section so don\u2019t worry what it looks like for now. Selecting data sets Now that you have selected an area you have to select the data that you need. Back in the panel on the left, under Select Data Products , drop down each of the headings in turn There are a lot of different data sets here and most of them won\u2019t mean anything to you. For now select the following data sets when you find them, by putting a tick in the box next to them. Backdrop mapping: VectorMap Local Raster Land and Height data: OS Terrain 5 Contours You can get more information about the data sets by clicking on the arrow next to them. This includes information on licences. The number on the right in brackets under Order Size shows how many tiles your selected area uses out of the maximum downloadable number. If you have chosen a slightly different area to me your number may be different. When you have selected the data you require click on Add to Basket (Don\u2019t worry, despite the Basket and Checkout you won\u2019t be charged. The University has already paid the subscription.) Your basket should appear with details of your order. Some datasets will give you an option to change the format. In this case click on Select Format next to the OS Terrain 5 Contours. The choices are Shape, GML3 or DWG . Choose Shape in this case. You may also need to select a theme. For the VectorMap Local Raster there is a choice of themes - pick Black and white for this exercise, though it is worth downloading the others to have a look at them too. Some items will have a Clip option. This means that the data will be sent to you clipped to the area outline that you requested. If you are short of disk space this is very useful as it restricts the amount of data you need to download, but otherwise it doesn\u2019t hurt to have extra data around the outside of your study area. I prefer to untick this box and download full map tiles. Give the order a name, e.g. Otley . This will be part of the file name of the zip file that you download, so try to make it short but helpful! Click on Request Download Downloading your data. You\u2019ll receive an email confirming your order, then another with a download link. This can sometimes take a while to arrive, depending on how busy the service is. Make sure that you are still logged in to Digimap before you click on the download link. Once you have clicked on the link a browser window should open telling you that your order is ready to download. Click on Download You\u2019ll download a zip file. NOTE: Don\u2019t run or open the file directly from your browser, and make sure that you DON\u2019T save your zip file to a temp folder where you will probably be unable to unzip it. Warning Make sure that you remember where you have saved the zip file. Now open File Explorer (in Windows) and navigate to the location where you saved the zip file. Right-click on the compressed map data file that downloaded and choose 7-zip > Extract files... Select where you want to save the extracted files, and make a note of where you save them to You should end up with a folder for each dataset that you requested. Viewing your data In this case the files that you have downloaded are either tiff graphics files or shapefiles. Navigate to the data that you downloaded and find the folder called something like vml-raster_bwr_3612556 (your order number will be different). Open one of the .tif files by double-clicking on it - the file should open in a graphics program, but that depends what you have set up on your computer. You should be able to see that this is basically a \u201cpicture\u201d of a map. Try opening one of the .shp files from the terrain-5_3612555 folder too. It\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to. Warning Both folders will contain files that have similar names to the .shp and .tif files, but different file extensions. These won\u2019t open in any programme but are essential for using the data in GIS programs such as ArcGIS, so make sure that you always keep these files together. Both of these formats will open in ArcGIS Pro and we\u2019ll have a look at these in the next chapter. Keep this data safe Keep the two datasets that you have downloaded for now. You will need to use them for the exercises in the next chapter. Copyright acknowledgements for Digimap data Copyright is important. Remember that most data providers ask you to sign up to conditions that include an obligation to add a copyright acknowledgement to your map. Check what that copyright statement is and add it. When you signed up to use the Digimap collections you agreed to add copyright acknowledgements whenever you created a map with the data. The wording does change from time to time so it\u2019s worth knowing how to check it for yourself. To find these copyright acknowledgements: go to the Digimap Resource Centre ( Resources at the top of the main Digimap page) Look for a link to Digimap Licence Agreements under Popular Resources and click on it Click on the End User or Sub-licence agreement for the data that you\u2019ve used then look for the information under In return, you must: - that gives you the acknowledgement text. For example, as of August 2020 when you use Ordnance Survey data obtained from Digimap you are expected to add the following text to your maps. \u00a9 Crown copyright and database rights year . Ordnance Survey (100025252). Where year is replaced by the current year. Adding the copyright symbol to your text To add the copyright symbol - \u00a9 - to your text check that the Num lock is on on the keyboard hold down the Alt key on the keyboard then use the number pad to type 0169 release the Alt key Remember that you do have to acknowledge each different dataset that you use and will have signed up to that when you registered. If you are not using U.K. Ordnance Survey data this is not the correct copyright acknowledgement to use. For example, if you are using data for Spain or the United States, or indeed UK data that you haven\u2019t downloaded from Digimap. You\u2019ll need to find the correct copyright acknowledgement for yourself. Advice on citing Digimap data , as opposed to the copyright acknowledgement is given in the Digimap Resource Centre. The GIS Lounge page on How to cite GIS materials gives some information about citing the software as well as the data. Have a look at that and follow the suggestions to cite non-Digimap data. Other Digimap collections In addition to Ordnance Survey Digimap you will also find that you\u2019ll make use of some of the other collections, in particular Geology Digimap and Aerial Digimap . The Roam and Download interfaces work in a very similar way to the Ordnance Survey collection so you should find that you already know how to use them. You have access to all of these collections so feel free to have a look at what is available and make use of any of the data or maps in your work. Digimap Collections online help Digimap help is available from each of the collection pages. Click on the links in the left-hand menu for more information about how to use the services and file formats. Alternatively use the Help links from within Roam or Download or use the videos that EDINA have uploaded to YouTube If you want more detailed information EDINA provide e-learning units which are linked from the main Digimap home page . Data from the web EDINA Digimap provides a wide range of useful data covering the UK, but you are also likely to need data from outwith the UK, or UK data that isn\u2019t provided by Digimap. It isn\u2019t possible to cover everything in this session, but I will show you one particular source which you should find useful. Natural Earth Data Natural Earth is a free, public domain dataset consisting of raster and vector data that will allow you to make maps at general scales. If you want a map of the World, or a general map of a particular country, this is a good starting point. Start by going to Natural Earth in your browser The front page gives an overview of the principles behind the data and an idea of the scales at which it is available. You can find more information under the Features tab, including the file formats and the coordinate system - both important for using the data within GIS. Natural Earth data Make a note of the file types of both the raster and vector data provided by Natural Earth, and of the coordinate system that the data comes in. To download data either Click the Get the Data green button on the front page or click on the Downloads tab at the top of the site Choose the scale that you want to download and the type of data that you want, e.g. cultural, physical or raster For this exercise download the following data: Medium scale data, 1:50m > Cultural > Admin 0 - Countries - click on the Download countries button to download a zip file. Make a note of where this file is saved to on your disk. Medium scale data, 1:50m > Raster > Natural Earth 1 - click the Download small size button under Natural Earth 1 with Shaded Relief and Water . Again, make a note of where the zip file is saved. Keep these data layers for later exercises. If you are working on a University computer you will need to make sure that the files are within your own disk space, either on your M: drive, or a USB drive. Have a look at the summary of the data on the Features page. If you wish try downloading other datasets. You can try adding them to ArcGIS Pro in the next section. Natural Earth data copyright Finding and acknowledging the copyright of data is very important. Return to the Natural Earth front page Look at the text in the box next to the Get the Data button. One of the links there is to the Terms of Use page. Click on that now. Acknowledging Natural Earth data Read the Terms of Use of Natural Earth data How should you acknowledge the Natural Earth data if you use it in one of your maps? The terms of use do say that \u201cCrediting the authors is unnecessary\u201d, however, it is still a good idea to add the data acknowledgement to your map to avoid any possibility of plagiarism. You can choose whether to use the short or long text listed on the page. Adding the url of the data can also be a very good idea. ESRI Living Atlas The ESRI Living Atlas is a fantastic resource of maps and data that you can add to your own maps. Follow the instructions below to have a look at some of the data, but it\u2019s worth exploring further and seeing what else is available to you. Download a blank project You\u2019ll work in a blank ArcGIS Project for this exercise so go to this week in Minerva and download the zip file - LivingAtlasEx.zip . Unzip the file to your GIS folder and double-click on the .aprx file to open the project in ArcGIS Pro. You should find you have a map of the World Adding data from the Living Atlas In the Catalog pane on the right of the screen click on the heading for Portal The panel will open with a row of icons at the top. Hover over each of those to see what they are, then click on the icon for Living Atlas Start by typing volcano in the search box and press the enter key A lot of the entries will be in Japanese, but if you hover over each layer you\u2019ll see more information about them. Hover over the entry for Significant Global Volcanic Eruptions The information for Significant Global Volcanic Eruptions tells you that it is a Feature Layer (Hosted) . This means that it is a layer, not a map, and that it is hosted on an ESRI ArcGIS web server. Double-click on the Significant Global Volcanic Eruptions heading to display the layer(s) that make up this data In this case there is only one layer - Significant_Volcanic_Eruption Right-click on the heading for the layer and Add to current map The data should appear on your map, with a key in the Contents pane on the left. Feature layers Try using the Explore tool to click on some of the little volcano symbols that should have been added to your map. You should get more information about significant eruptions. Also right-click on the layer and open the Attribute table - have a look at the data that has been included for each eruption. Return to the search box on the Living Atlas panel and try some other searches, for example search for geology . Look at the information for some of the entries that appear then try adding some of the other layers to your map by right-clicking and either adding to the current map, or to a new map. In some cases, they will open as a new map, in others they should be added to your existing map. Try some of your own searches to see what else is available, e.g. a particular country. You can experiment at this stage. It doesn\u2019t matter if something goes wrong or ArcGIS crashes. You don\u2019t need to keep this map and you can easily open a new copy. Finding other data online These are just a few examples of finding useful data for GIS. Through out the rest of the workbook you\u2019ll be downloading your own data from Digimap. If you need data from elsewhere I\u2019ll either give full instructions or provide the data for you, but tell you where I got it from.

Obtaining and opening the sample map The sample map is based on British Geological Survey (BGS) data covering Malham Tarn in North Yorkshire and uses data from a number of sources with which you will become familiar during this module. download the MalhamMinerva.zip file from Minerva and save it so that you can remember where it is located. Create a new folder called gis - look at the box below to see where to create it Where to save your work if you are on your own computer choose a location where you usually save your files - preferably on an internal drive such as c: if you are on a University cluster machine create it on your m:/ drive if you are using the University Virtual Windows Desktop create the new folder on the desktop. You will then need to remember to move it to your network m:/ drive or One Drive before you log off the VWD To create the folder once you are in the correct location right-click and choose New folder... unzip the downloaded file to your gis folder. In My Computer right-click on the 7zip or zip file 7-zip > Extract Files... - select the location to save the files to and click OK or, if you don\u2019t have 7-zip, right-click, Extract Files\u2026 - select the location to save the files to and click OK Warning Never try to use the contents of a zipped file in Arc without extracting it first - it won\u2019t work. If you are looking for a file in Arc and can\u2019t find it, always check via My Computer that the file isn\u2019t inside a zip or 7zip archive. Open the sample map Open Arc by searching for __ArcGIS Pro_ in the start menu of your computer and clicking on it. Be patient - Arc can open slowly sometimes! From the splash screen select to Open another project . If you don\u2019t have the splash screen use Project > Open Navigate to the folder in which you unzipped the downloaded file and open Malham.aprx Alternatively you can navigate in Windows Explorer to the folder to which you unzipped the downloaded data Go into the Malham folder and double-click on the Malham.aprx file - the map should open (slowly\u2026) Your ArcGIS window should look similar to the figure below: The map ribbon The menu ribbon at the top of the window gives you a variety of tools. Hover over the buttons to see the tooltips that explain what each button will do. Try out the navigation tools Have a look for each of the tools suggested below and try them out to see what they do. Remember that you can use the tool tips to identify the tools. Make notes for yourself so you remember this in future. Fixed zoom in - also try using the mouse wheel to zoom in and out Fixed zoom out Full extent Zoom to layer - this one isn\u2019t on the ribbon. Right-click on the title of the BedrockGeol layer in the contents pane then select Zoom To Layer 1 Click the Select button then click and hold on the map, drag out a rectangle, and let go of the mouse button. What happens? Why do you think this is? Click on the Clear button in the Selection group. Now what happens? Click on Explore , then click on one of the bedrock geology areas on the map. Also try some of the options found by clicking on the down arrow under the Explore button. Click on Locate . The locate pane should open on the right of your map. Type Malham Tarn House in the search box and select one of the results 2 . Change scale Instead of zooming in and out with the mouse wheel you can change to a particular scale, e.g. 1:100 000, by simply using the drop down box at the bottom of the window to select the scale you want. You can also type a scale in this box, particularly if the scale you want isn\u2019t in the list, e.g. 1:50 000 (note that you can type it in with no punctuation), and it will change to that when you press return . Spatial bookmarks Spatial bookmarks enable you to go back to a view that you have set up earlier. The map of Malham Tarn has a bookmark set up showing the area of the Malham Tarn National Nature Reserve. Spatial bookmarks in Arc This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . To open the bookmark: Go to Bookmarks on the ribbon and select Malham Tarn NNR To set up your own bookmarks: Pan the map to a different location and change the scale if you want to Bookmarks > New Bookmark... then type a name for your bookmark and click OK The bookmark should be visible as a thumbnail when you click on Bookmarks again. How does the spatial bookmark affect scale? Change the scale of the map and pan to a different view, then go to the bookmark that you have just set and check the scale again. How has the bookmark affected that? The Bookmark Manager allows you to view all of your spatial bookmarks, sort them, and remove any that you no longer need. Bookmarks > Manage Bookmarks... Try creating another bookmark in the manager Experiment with the options in the manager, including Zoom To and Pan To Remove the last book mark that you created Catalog pane The Catalog pane allows you to explore and find out more information about your data. If the catalog pane isn\u2019t visible on the right of the window already, go to View > Catalog Pane on the ribbon to open it. Explore the tree in the Catalog pane by opening out all of the subheadings (click on the small arrows). You should end up with something like the image below. The view that you have been working in shows a Map and this is available under the Maps heading in the Catalog. If you close your map you can reopen it from here. The Layouts heading shows any print layouts that have been set up. You should already be able to see one, just called \u201cLayout\u201d. The heading for Databases shows the geodatabase which contains most of the information which makes up the map. If you open out the geodatabase Malham.gdb you can see the data feature classes that are stored within in. There is another subheading for Folders . This has a \u201chome\u201d folder for this project - Malham . You can also add other folders here so that you can add data from outside of your project. See the information on for how to do this. Working with map layers Layers are an essential part of any GIS. Each layer is a reference to a particular data source. In the Malham map project the layers include: SuperficialGeol LinearGeol Contours Layers in the Malham map What are the names of the other layers in the Malham map? Layers are controlled from the Contents pane to the left of the map window. Working with layers in Arc Go to the module area of Minerva or the full list of video clips and watch the video clip on working with layers. If you are working in a cluster you will need your own headphones to avoid disturbing other students. Once you have watched the video clip get used to working with layers by following the instructions below. Viewing contents of layers In the contents pane: Click on the small arrow next to a layer to open and close the layer contents The contents pane also acts as a key to your map and shows the symbols for map features Renaming layers in the contents pane You can make the layer names more useful by changing them in the contents pane. This also means that the names are clearer when you generate legends prior to printing or exporting maps. Note that you are not renaming the original data file by doing this, but just changing how the name appears in Arc. You should get into the habit of doing this as it makes it easier to see what your layers contain. Select BedrockGeol in the contents pane and press F2 on the keyboard, or double-click slowly on the layer name Type the new, more descriptive name, e.g. Bedrock geology (with a space) and then press Enter Turn layers on and off Once a layer is in the contents pane you can turn the layer on and off to view or work with other data, without needing to remove it completely. Click in the box next to the Bedrock geology layer title to turn the bedrock geology off in the map Turn other layers on and off and see what the map looks like but finish with all of the current layers visible. Add new layers There are two simple ways to add new layers. Adding new layers to Arc and Add Folder Connection This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . Add data command Try the following: Map ribbon > Add data... then navigate to the folder in which you unzipped the map - you\u2019ll need to start by going into Folders in the browse dialog, then go to the Malham > vml-raster_bwr > sd folder, and add sd86ne.tif When you add tif or jpg files to Arc for the first time as a layer it sometimes asks you whether you want to create pyramids . It\u2019s your choice, but usual advice is to select yes to create them. Pyramids can save time when you are zooming in and out of your map but take a while to create when you first load the file 3 . If you can\u2019t find the folder in order to add the image follow the instructions in the Add Folder Connection section. This is an example of a VectorMap Local layer in black and white. The data is available in colour too, but as a background for a geological map black and white tends to be clearer. Zoom in closer and you\u2019ll be able to see more detail (if you can\u2019t see the layer make sure that it is above all the other layers in the contents pane - you can change the order by dragging layers around in the pan). There are three other tif files in this folder too so to add those: Go to Map ribbon > Add data... and make sure you are in the Malham > vml-raster_bwr > sd folder again Click on one of the remaining three files then hold down the Shift key or the Ctrl key and click on the other two to select them too Click OK In this way you can add as many files as you want in one go. Drag and drop Instead of clicking on add data, the alternative is to simply find the file in the Catalog pane and drag and drop it onto the map area or into the contents pane. The Catalog pane should be visible to the right of your map. If it isn\u2019t click the View tab on the ribbon and click on the Catalog pane . You should see something that looks like the image below. In the Catalog pane go to the Folders section, go into the Malham > Malham.gdb folder and drag and drop National_Nature_Reserves_England on to your map. If you drag it over to the contents pane you can choose whereabouts in the layer structure it will appear - add it to the top so that you can see it. If you can\u2019t find the folder in order to add the image follow the instructions in the Add Folder Connection section. If you can\u2019t see the new layer try using Zoom to layer to make sure you are in the right place on the map. Your map should look similar to the image below. National_Nature_Reserves_England , as it says, shows all of the National Nature Reserves in England, which includes the Malham Tarn National Nature Reserve (NNR). You\u2019ll need the National_Nature_Reserves_England layer and background layers again, so leave them visible on your map. Warning While it is possible to add data by dragging and dropping from Windows file explorer it really isn\u2019t a good idea to do that. It might look as if it has worked at first, but things can go horribly wrong\u2026 Instead use one of the two methods listed above. Adding a folder connection in the Catalog pane If you can\u2019t see your M:/ drive or USB device in the list of folders when adding data or viewing the catalog you need to Connect to folder . Right-click on the Folders subheading in the Catalog panel Add Folder Connection (see image below) and select your top level gis folder, or your M: drive then click OK . If you select the drive that you want, rather than navigating right to the file, you\u2019ll be able to navigate to any files within it. Now select your files from the folder that you can see. On cluster computers you\u2019ll probably find that you have to repeat this each time you start work in Arc, unfortunately. Add folder connection Add a folder to the Folders heading using the Add folder connection command now to check that you can do it. Change the order of layers Changing the order of layers is simple once you remember that they \u201cstack up\u201d in the order in which they appear on the contents pane. So the layers towards the top will cover up the layers lower down. To change the order of layers so that the National_Nature_Reserves_England layer is below one of the Background layers, simply use the mouse to drag the layer down to the bottom of the contents pane and drop it there. You should find that the background layers cover up the National Nature Reserve layer so that it is no longer visible. Move the National_Nature_Reserves_England layer back up to the top of the contents so that you can see it again. Check where the contours layer is in the contents. If it is below the black and white tif layers that you added, move it so that it is above those. Make layers transparent Use the bookmark to go to the Malham Tarn NNR on your map. ( Spatial bookmarks .) You should be able to see that the polygon making up the reserve is symbolised in a solid colour which hides the detail of the base map underneath. We need to make the layer transparent so that it is still possible to see the detail of the layers below it in the contents pane. Start by making sure that you have the National Nature Reserves layer switched on, then select it in the contents pane. Try to have your contents pane looking something like the image below. Click to open the Appearance tab on the ribbon. The Effects group contains a slider to control transparency and a box showing percentage. 0% is fully opaque, 100% is fully transparent. Try several steps between 30 and 60% and see what difference it makes. Transparency Using the above instructions move the layers around in the contents pane and change transparency for various layers, just to see what the possibilities are. Grouping layers The three geological layers are related to each other and could be grouped together to organise the map. Amongst other advantages this would make it easier to turn all of the geology layers on and off together. Right-click on the word Map in the contents pane. Select New Group Layer , click on the New Group Layer that appears and give it a name such as Geology that tells you what the group is. New use the mouse to drag the SuperficialGeol; LinearGeol and BedrockGeol layers so that they appear indented underneath the layer name. Try turning off the Geology group layer to check that all of your layers are actually together. Don\u2019t forget to turn them back on again! You can also select several layers first and then group them as follows: Select the contours layer and the four black and white tif background layers using the Shift or Ctrl keys to allow you to select multiple layers Right-click on the selected layers and click on Group New rename the group title to something like Background map Remove layers You added four black and white background tif maps, but only two of those are actually needed for your final map. It can be a good idea to keep the amount of data in your project down to what you really need - though it makes more difference for a large area, or a large amount of data. To remove the layers you don\u2019t need: Right-click on the sd96sw.tif layer in the contents pane then Remove and do the same with the sd86se.tif layer Note that this doesn\u2019t delete the data from your disk, it just removes the link to it from your map. Check this in the Catalog pane - the layers should still be available if you want to add them back in again. Using Basemaps The lowest layers on your map are probably called something like World Topographic Map and World Hillshade . To make sure that you can see these layers turn off the layers above it by unticking the boxes. If you\u2019ve grouped layers you should just be able to turn off the groups. If you look at the Source for the World Topographic Map by double-clicking on the layer and choosing the Source heading, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s Data Type is listed as Vector Tile Service . The data type for the World Hillshade will be ArcGIS Map Service . When you create a new map in ArcGIS Pro you are automatically given a basemap of this type. It\u2019s useful as it gives you some idea of where you are. These layers are also very convenient as background maps, and it is possible to change the basemap that your map uses. Warning You do have to wait a bit sometimes for these layers to load as they are downloading data over the internet, then reprojecting it to appear on your map. For this reason it is often not a good idea to rely on these maps. If you find that your maps are loading very slowly, or that you have to wait a long time for anything to display, turn off the ESRI background layers or, even better, remove them completely from your map. They can cause maps to become extremely unstable and start to crash. On the Map tab of the ribbon click on the down arrow under Basemap From the list of alternatives click on Imagery Hybrid (this has the imagery with labels, roads, borders etc added) Trying out ESRI basemaps Have a look at the Imagery Hybrid layer, then try out some of the others. When you\u2019ve investigated turn this layer off as you will need to use the background black and white layer instead. Turn the rest of the layers on your map back on. Viewing an attribute table Data for GIS is stored in tables as feature attributes . You can view the attribute table to get an overview of your data, and to carry out some useful operations. Working with attribute tables in Arc This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . Right-click on the Bedrock geology layer in the contents pane and click on Attribute table . A pane that looks similar to the image below should open at the bottom of your map window. Have a look at the structure of the table: Each row contains one record - the details for one feature on the map. Each column is one field - or attribute . That is, related information for each feature, such as Label. If you are working with polygon features in a geodatabase 4 , as you are here, the Shape_Length and Shape_Area fields will automatically be created and filled in with the length of the outline and the area of the polygon. Try scrolling across to see these fields in the Bedrock geology attribute table. If you are working with line features in a geodatabase the Shape_length field will automatically be created and filled in with the length of the line. The measurements will be in map units - find out what these are set to by right-clicking on Map (the title of the map frame) in the contents pane and going to Properties . Under General look at Map units . Map units What are the map units of the current map? Make a note for yourself. This information will be useful later. Selecting features in the attribute table It can be useful to be able to select features directly in the attribute table rather than by having to click on the map, for example, if you can already see the attributes for the feature that you want to select! Selecting features with the attribute table This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . In the attribute table click on the little grey area to the left of one of the records. The feature will be selected in the table, and will also be selected on the map. You\u2019ll probably need to right-click on the little grey area then select Pan to . The map will move so that the selected feature is in the centre, and the selected feature will flash. Selected features are marked in a bright turquoise colour in the attribute table and a turquoise outline on the map. Use the Select tool from the Map tab of the ribbon to click on a bedrock feature on the map and notice that this selects the same feature in the attribute table. In the attribute table click in the grey area next to the first of the features that you can see. Now hold down the Ctrl key and click on the third feature. In this way you can select more than one feature at a time. The up arrow will also work. To view only your selections click on the Show selected records button at the bottom left of the attribute table pane. To view all records again click on Show all records . Remember that if you hover over a button you\u2019ll see a tooltip telling you what the button does. to clear selections click on the Clear button either on the attribute table top bar or in the Selection group on the ribbon. Right-click on the Shape_Length column heading and click on Sort Ascending . This will reorder the table from low to high by the length of the feature, so the shortest at the top. Attribute table selections Play around with the attribute table and explore what else you can do. When you\u2019ve finished, clear all selections by clicking on Clear in the Selection group of the Map ribbon, then Close the attribute table pane by clicking on the cross on the tab at the top of it. Finding help for ArcGIS I\u2019ve been throwing a lot of new terms at you here. Don\u2019t worry - most of them will become more familiar as the course goes on. Don\u2019t forget that you will be able to look back at these instructions. You can search the document if you are looking for specific techniques. In addition you can make use of some resources provided by ESRI, the company who produce ArcGIS. ArcGIS Pro Help ArcGIS Pro Help is available online . You\u2019ll find this useful when you start using more advanced tools in Arc, but if you\u2019re not sure of something it is worth searching in the help. As an example go to the ArcGIS Pro Help pages and use the search box at the top to search for select feature attribute . You\u2019ll get a lot of results but the top one should be \u201cSelect features using attributes\u201d, which should be the most relevant. In addition, if you want to explore further ways to use GIS there are lots of tutorials available on the ESRI website . Do make sure that you look at tutorials that apply to ArcGIS Pro, not to any other version of Arc! ESRI GIS Dictionary The Dictionary can be useful if you need to remember what a particular term means. Go to the ESRI GIS dictionary Type Attribute table in the search box and press enter The answer should match what you\u2019ve already learnt in the attribute table section of these instructions. Practice using the dictionary by completing the exercises below. Using the GIS dictionary \u201cRaster\u201d and \u201cvector\u201d are the two main types of data structure used in GIS and you will come across these many times during this course. Use the GIS dictionary to find out what raster and vector mean and make a note of the definitions for yourself. Use diagrams if it will help you to remember the difference. Saving a map IMPORTANT: Develop the habit of saving your map projects at regular intervals. Arc can crash when carrying out some operations and you don\u2019t want to lose all of your work. Crashes can also corrupt data files, so copy the whole of your gis folder to another location or drive at frequent intervals (i.e. create a backup copy). It can be useful to rename each backup folder with the date of the backup, then you can make sure you keep a couple of copies to go back to if there are problems. To save your project: Either Project > Save from the menu or use the save icon on the quick access toolbar at the top left or use Ctrl + S on the keyboard Styling a layer Styling a single symbol At the moment the symbol for the National Nature Reserves is a polygon with a thin outline and a transparent fill. Let\u2019s change that so that the outline is thicker and there is no fill at all. Symbolising a layer as a single symbol in ArcGIS Pro This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . Right-click on the National Nature Reserves layer and click on Symbology OR click on Symbology on the Appearance tab of the ribbon The Symbology pane should open to the right of the map window. The layer is symbolised as a single symbol - a single random colour which is used for all polygons in the layer, as shown below. Click on the coloured \u201cpatch\u201d next to Symbol The Gallery should open, if it doesn\u2019t click on the Gallery heading at the top of the panel The gallery shows you lots of choices of symbology, try some of them out but finish by clicking on Black Outline (2pts) - you may need to hover over items to see the full names. As soon as you click on a new symbol in the gallery the features on your map should change. While there are a lot of symbols available, they may not always be quite what you need. For the NNR outline we\u2019ll change the colour of the line. Click on the Properties heading at the top of the Symbology panel Change the Outline color to something bright which will stand out against the rest of your map Because you selected just an outline in the gallery the Color choice is No Color . If you want to add a fill colour you can select it here Press Apply to change the style of the features on your map Styling with multiple symbols (Unique Values) Make the SuperficialGeol layer in the Malham map visible by clicking the little box next to it so that it is ticked. At the moment the layer is symbolised as a single colour. By using multiple colours, or classes, you can make your map much more informative. Open the attribute table for the SuperficialGeol layer and have a look at the data that it contains. The column headed RCS_D contains information on what type of unconsolidated deposits are shown by each feature. Make a note of the field name. Close the attribute table Right-click on the SuperficialGeol layer and click on Symbology Symbolising a layer by unique values in ArcGIS Pro This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . To symbolise the layer as multiple colours by geology type: Select Unique Values in the dropdown box at the top of the symbology pane In the Field 1 box that appears select RCS_D - the field we were looking at earlier You should find that you get a list of the values of RCS_D to which Arc will have assigned random colours. You can change the colours and thicknesses of the lines by clicking on each symbol in turn - click on the \u201cpatch\u201d next to PEAT now. If you click on the Gallery heading you\u2019ll get a choice of preset styles - click on one of them now, e.g. Cultural . You should see the new symbol appear for some of the features on your map. As with the single symbology , in the Properties heading you can set up your own styles. Click on this heading and try making some of the line widths thicker, and change the colour of the symbol. This time you\u2019ll need to click on Apply to see the result on your map Click on the back arrow at the top of the pane to go back to the full list and try setting the other symbols too You may find it easier to see what you are doing if you turn off all of the other layers in the contents pane. Selecting and intersecting two different layers Now that you have your data in a GIS, why not take advantage of its power? You can use GIS to select features which are within a certain distance of features in another layer. For example, which bedrock geology features appear within 2 km of, and in Malham Tarn NNR? We can use Select by location to find out. Make sure that both the bedrock geology and the National Nature Reserves layers are visible in your map. Exporting a selection of a feature class Zoom to layer on the NNR layer and you should be able to see that it covers the whole of England. To start with here we\u2019ll create a feature class which just includes the Malham Tarn NNR - this will make the next step simpler and save time as you won\u2019t be processing data that you don\u2019t need. Right-click on the layer containing the data that you want to select - in this case the National Nature Reserves layer Data > Export features - to bring up a dialog that should look like the image below Choose to save the new Output feature class in the project geodatabase (Malham.gdb) and give your output a name, e.g. MalhamTarnNNR - note no spaces in the feature class name To select just Malham Tarn NNR do the following: Click on the New Expression button In the three boxes next to Where fill in NNR_NAME - using the dropdown box contains the text - again using the dropdown box type in Malham Tarn then click to Run The new layer should be automatically added to your map. To check that this has worked properly Zoom to layer on your new layer and check that the outline of the Malham Tarn NNR fills the map area. Now remove the original national nature reserves layer from the contents list and you should be left with just the Malham Tarn Reserve which you had selected via the expression. Try symbolising the reserve as a single, green outline symbol with no fill. Select by location Select by location allows you to select features based on their relationship to another layer, or other features. This is one of the key tasks in GIS and it is extremely useful to know how to do this, for example, if you want to export a subset of features that match the area that you are studying. Select by location This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . From the Map tab of the ribbon click on the button to Select by Location The dialog should open in the Geoprocessing pane on the right. Fill it in as shown below (see the image below too). Input Features should be the layer which contains the features that you wish to select, in this case the Bedrock geology Relationship should be set to Intersect (but have a look at the other options which are available) Selecting Features is the layer that indicates the location you want to select against, so the Malham Tarn NNR We\u2019ll also add a small margin so that bedrock areas which have parts within 2 km of the nature reserve will also be selected, so enter the Search distance as 2000 metres. Selection type should be New selection Now click on Run at the bottom of the pane Now your map should show the bedrock geology features which are within 2 km of the Malham Tarn NNR outlined in the selection colour - probably bright blue/turquoise in this case. You may need to zoom in a bit to see them properly! Exporting selected features to a new feature class Once you have selected the features you can make the selection permanent by exporting it to a new feature class. Right-click on the layer containing the selection - the bedrock geology layer Data > Export features Choose to save the new Output feature class in the project geodatabase (Malham.gdb) and give your output a name, e.g. MalhamGeology Then Run the tool The new layer should be automatically added to your map. Now remove the original bedrock geology layer and you should be left with just the features which you had selected and exported. Try symbolising them using Unique Values so that each type of bedrock geology is a different colour. Use LEX_RCS_I as Field 1. How many features? How many features are there in the new layer showing only the bedrock geology within 2 km of the Malham Tarn NNR? You should be able to tell by opening the attribute table for the layer. Layout - laying out a map for print or export So far we have been working in the Map . If you print the map from here you have little control over its appearance. To produce a professional-looking map you need to use a layout . The information given here is just a quick introduction, you\u2019ll cover layout and presentation in more detail in a later section. In the Catalog pane open out the Layouts subheading and double-click on the Layout The layout window looks similar to the map window, but shows the layout as it will appear when printed or exported. You still have the contents pane on the left of the screen and the ribbon at the top, but the ribbon will offer some different options. On the ribbon go to the Layout tab. Use the buttons in the Navigate group to zoom in and out of the layout and move around it Try the tools in the Map group on the Layout tab in this view too. In addition you can open out the contents of the Map Frame in the Contents and Zoom to Layer on any of the layers, just as you did in Map view. To move the actual map, rather than the layout, you need to click on the Activate button in the Map group on the Layout tab. Once you\u2019ve done that you can pan and zoom the area of the map using the mouse. Once you\u2019ve finished click on the back arrow at the top of the Layout window to get back to the usual Layout view. Zooming in layout view What is the difference between zooming with the tools in the Navigate group of the Layout tab and with the tools in the Map group in layout view? To get back to the original view use the bookmarks just as you did earlier. There should be a bookmark called Malham Tarn NNR that you can click on. Adding elements to the layout Most of the maps that you create will need to be printed out with additional content such as a title, a key or legend, a scale bar and some text. I\u2019ve already added a measured grid and a scale bar to this layout. You\u2019ll add a title and copyright text to this map but you\u2019ll learn more about layout in a later chapter. Adding a scalebar, title and text to a layout This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . To add text To add text to your layout: Go to the Insert tab on the ribbon In the Text group click on Text then select the top option - Text Click on the layout somewhere close to where you want the text to appear (you can move it later!) Type the text that you want to add - for now type the text below as a title - then click elsewhere on the layout to come out of the text box. The geology of Malham Tarn National Nature Reserve Formatting text You\u2019re likely to want to change the default text option. There are books about cartography on the reading list which give more information about font choices, but for now use the instructions below to play around with the options.

Adding copyright text Copyright acknowledgement is important! Always check the terms and conditions for any data that you use. Most will tell you the wording that you should use - though it can take a bit of finding sometimes!. When you sign up to the Digimap service for UK data you\u2019ll find out more about the correct acknowledgements you need to use for their data. For this map, which uses data from Digimap, add the text below to your layout. If you are using an ESRI basemap the acknowledgement for that will automatically be added to your map - though it does sometimes cover rather a lot of the map.

Printing or exporting a map Don\u2019t worry about printing your map for now, but try exporting it as both a pdf and an image. Printing a layout To print your layout: If you need to change the paper size and orientation use the tools on the Layout ribbon Page Setup group To print go to the Share tab on the ribbon and click on the printer button in the Print group Set up the printer as you would usually 5 then click to Print Exporting a layout To export a layout to a pdf or an image: If you need to change the paper size and orientation use the tools on the Layout ribbon Page Setup group To export go to the Share tab on the ribbon and click on the green arrow in the Export group Select the format that you wish to export and give your file a name. Check the other options are correct and change as appropriate (you may find that the defaults are OK) and then Export Suggested layout Your final map could look something like the map below. It is unlikely to look identical as you should make your own decisions about where to place elements and how to display your map. Getting feedback on your layout Export your final layout as a pdf. If you email me your map I will give you feedback on what you have done so far. If you have any questions about this chapter please feel free to email me to ask or ask during the live sessions. Recommended reading: Introduction to GIS Many of the books in the reading list 6 have a general introduction to GIS which explain what it is and how it is used. Suggestions include the following: Chapter 1, What is GIS? in Heywood, I., Cornelius, S. and Carver, S. (2011), pp. 2-30 Chapter 1, Systems, Science and Study in Longley, P.A. et al.

Make sure that you allow the time to do this. Care and patience can make the difference between a scruffy, unimpressive map that loses you marks, and a clear, professional map that gives a good first impression. Warning Don\u2019t underestimate the time that the final details can take and don\u2019t leave this part of the preparation until the last hour before a deadline! You won\u2019t need to use all of the elements and features outlined here for every map. Equally this is not an exhaustive list of possible elements. You should already have some idea of what elements are useful, and should be able to make a decision for each case based on your existing knowledge of maps. If you think that you need to add something that is not listed here, e.g. a report based on a table, then use the extra information available in the bibliography, further information and on-line to find out how to add it. So this chapter isn\u2019t necessarily for working through in order. Make sure that you are aware of the contents and of what Arc is able to do, and then make your own decisions about what you need to include based on the principles that will be covered in class. Viewing a map layout In Arc a layout allows you to control the format and scale at which you print your map, and lay out additional elements to complete the final product. Open any map that you have created previously in Arc Add a layout by going to the Insert tab of the ribbon and clicking on New Layout You\u2019ll be given a choice of paper sizes - for this map select A4 portrait A new layout will open as a new tab over the map and will show a blank page. The ribbon will change to give you options relevant to layout. In this view you will see your map laid out as it will be when it is finally printed or exported. You\u2019ll see the page outlined on screen and, once you have started adding elements, you will see the content on top of it. Adding a map frame to a blank layout The first thing you need to do is add your map to the layout. Do this as follows: Click on Map Frame on the Insert tab of the ribbon If you just click on the button you\u2019ll be given a World Map If you click on the arrow underneath Map Frame you\u2019ll be given some options which include any spatial bookmarks that you have set up 1 and the map views in your project. Click on any of the options to add a map frame to your layout. If you have a map showing the World you can zoom in to the area of your data. Making use of the contents pane in layout view As when you\u2019re working on your map, layout view makes use of the Contents pane on the left of the window. The headings will usually be folded, but use the little arrows next to the headings to open them out and see the contents. The top heading is the layout itself. Within that you\u2019ll find all of the elements on your page. This includes any map frames (there can be more than one), but also scale bars, legends, text etc. As with the contents pane for a map, elements are drawn in the order that they are listed here. So if you want something to appear above something else, make sure that it is above it in the table of contents. You can select any element within the contents list and move it on the layout or edit its properties in the pane on the right. An element can be \u201clocked\u201d in place by clicking on the padlock symbol next to its name. Size and map scale of layout Page size and map scale Warning Changing the size of the page can sometimes change the scale, so each time you alter the page size check the scale of your map again! You may need to change the page size as you add more elements to your layout. Setting the size and scale of a map layout This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . Click on the Layout tab of the ribbon the Orientation button allows you to change between portrait and landscape orientation the small button to the right of that one is for Size - hover over it to see the tool tip. This allows you to choose from a wide range of standard sizes, or use Custom page size... if you need something different. Change page size and orientation Change your page orientation and size to A3 landscape. This will give you more space to experiment with adding other elements to your page. Resizing the map frame in a layout When you first set up a layout, the size of the map frame that you see will not necessarily be the size that you want. Changing the size of the map frame is easy, but can take a little experimentation. You will also need to look at this in conjunction with the instructions on changing paper size in the previous section. Resizing the map frame in a layout This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . Make sure that the map frame that you want to resize is selected in the layout by clicking on it When the map frame is selected you should be able to see that it has small boxes at the corner and on each side. Use the boxes as \u201chandles\u201d to resize the map frame by clicking on them and dragging Keep an eye on the scale dropdown! You may need to put this back to your required scale and then resize the map frame again If you need to move the area of the map itself you need to Activate the map by right-clicking on it and selecting Activate Move the map as appropriate then go to the top of the layout window, where there is an arrow pointing to the right, and click on Layout to get back to the previous view. Keep repeating the above actions until the size/extent and scale of your map are correct. Warning This process can take patience to get the map frame the correct size for the scale and area. There don\u2019t appear to be any short cuts so just stick with it and keep repeating the process! Setting a fixed extent It is possible to set the view to show a particular extent, but be warned that if you do this it then becomes impossible to change the scale of your map in either map or layout view, and you won\u2019t be able to resize the map frame in a layout or pan your map in map view. If you\u2019ve been asked to produce a map at a particular scale this won\u2019t be a good idea! If you\u2019ve been asked to produce a map of a particular area this probably isn\u2019t so bad. In a layout click on the Map Frame in the Contents In the Format Map Frame panel on the right of the window go to the second button across - if you hover over it, it will say Display options Use the dropdown box under Constraint to select your choice, e.g. Fixed Extent and set the Location Settings as appropriate To get back to the default of being able to pan etc., just set the Constraint back to None It is also possible to set the dropdown to Fixed Scale , which can be useful, but does mean that if you are still working on your map it isn\u2019t possible to zoom in and work on details. Adding elements to a layout The information below includes details on adding many different elements to a layout. Not all of these will be appropriate to every layout, but it is up to you to decide which elements to use depending on the purpose and audience of your map and any guidelines specified for assessments or reports. Some of the references in the cartography section of the reading list should help you with this. Remember that Arc Help 2 will provide you with plenty of extra information on how to add map elements to a layout. Most elements are added to a layout in a similar way to each other using the Insert tab of the ribbon. In most cases you\u2019ll then be presented with a properties dialogue which allows you to make changes to the element. Once they have been added to the page you can move the elements around. If you need to change properties then click on an element in the contents pane on the left. Adding a scalebar, title and text to a layout This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . Scale bar and scale text Some indication of scale should always be added to both printed and screen maps. A scale bar is a useful convention for both. Scale text (e.g. 1:50 000 or 1 cm = 1 km) is only relevant for printed maps, not for maps on screen where someone can zoom to any scale. If you add scale text you must also ensure that you print the map at the correct scale. To add a scale bar Click on Scale bar on the Insert tab of the ribbon Select an appropriate scale bar from the list - if you are working in a projected coordinate system such as British National Grid and the map units are metres, then use a metric scale bar You can make changes to the format of the scalebar in the properties pane on the right To change things such as the number of divisions and the units make sure that the scale bar is selected, then go to the Design tab on the ribbon To add scale text Click the little arrow next to Dynamic Text on the Insert tab of the ribbon Select Scale from the choices provided Arc will add text to your map which will automatically update if you change the scale of your map. It\u2019s worth having a look at what other text elements can be added via Dynamic Text too, e.g. information about the spatial reference. Title and text Maps almost always need an informative title so that people know what they are supposed to show. You should use the insert text command to add a title, or further text, such as your name (or for an assessment your student ID) as creator of the map, a copyright statement, acknowledgements, and further explanation. To add text: From the Insert tab of the ribbon click on the little arrow next to the Text button and select a form of text. Rectangle works best, particularly if you\u2019re likely to want to add a background, but feel free to try out the other options. Click on the layout, or click and drag for a rectangle, and type your text You can use the Format text pane on the right to change the text The Text symbol dialog will allow you to change the font, and font size Adding text to a layout Once you\u2019ve added some text to your layout explore the options in the Format text pane and the Text symbol dialog. Try changing your font, your font style and the size of the text. Also have a look at what some of the other options will do. Copyright acknowledgements Copyright is important. Remember that most data providers ask you to sign up to conditions that include an obligation to add a copyright to your map. Check what the required copyright statement is and add it. When you signed up to use the Digimap Collections you agreed to add copyright acknowledgements whenever you created a map with the data. These acknowledgements do change from time to time so it\u2019s worth knowing how to check the requirement for yourself: To find these copyright acknowledgements go to the Digimap Resource Centre ( Resources at the top of the main Digimap page) Look for a link to Digimap Licence Agreements and click on it Click on the End User or Sub-licence agreement for the data that you\u2019ve used then look for the information under In return, you must: - that gives you the acknowledgement text For example, as of April 2019, when you use Ordnance Survey data obtained from Digimap you are expected to add the following text to your map 3 : \u00a9 Crown copyright and database rights year . Ordnance Survey (100025252). Where year is replaced by the current year. Remember that you do have to acknowledge each different dataset that you use and will have signed up to that when you registered. Finding copyright acknowledgements Use the instructions above to find the correct copyright acknowledgement for British Geological Survey data downloaded from the Digimap Geology collection. Is it the same as the Ordnance Survey acknowledgement? If you are not using U.K. Ordnance Survey data this is not the correct copyright acknowledgement to use, for example, if you are using data for Spain or the United States, or indeed any UK data that you haven\u2019t downloaded from Digimap. You\u2019ll need to find the correct copyright acknowledgement for yourself. There is an article on GIS Lounge about How to cite GIS materials which you may find useful. It explains about citing the software as well as the data. Digimap also provide advice on citing Digimap data , as opposed to the copyright acknowledgement. Adding a key / legend to your layout You\u2019ll have added various data to your map, and it is necessary for you to explain to anyone looking at your map what those layers and symbols show. To do this you\u2019ll need a legend or key. You will usually start by using the default options to create a legend. Once you have the basic legend it is possible to make alterations later. Adding and editing a map legend This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . Click on Legend on the Insert tab of the ribbon then click close to where you want the legend to appear on your map (you will be able to move it later) Arc will automatically add all of your layers to legend, including those you don\u2019t want to include. Use the Contents pane to view the layers which are included in your legend by clicking on the arrow next to its heading to remove a layer from the legend just untick it in the Contents It is very likely that you will want to change the legend in some way to make it clearer - leaving the defaults is usually a very bad idea. Do as many of these changes as you can while it is still being generated automatically. Make sure that all the symbology is correct in the map contents Rename layers in the map contents pane so that they are in plain English (or what ever language you are using), e.g. no underscores, unexplained abbreviations, or other strange characters 4 . For example, in the default legend above the heading For_Eng either needs to be removed or written in full as something like Type of engineering required To change the format of an item right-click on it in the Layout contents pane and select Properties then try changing the options there. Converting a legend into a graphic Once you have all the basic information in your legend you can convert it to a graphic and you will have more flexibility to rearrange items. Note that once you have converted a legend to a graphic it will no longer change automatically if you change symbols or layers on your map, you will have to generate a new legend from scratch. So leave this step until you are happy with everything on your map. Right-click on the legend and Convert to Graphics Right-click on the legend again and Ungroup . Repeat the last step again as necessary on each part of the legend so that individual items become selectable. Now you should be able to select individual parts of your legend and move them around or delete them. For example, if you have lines with symbols that have been added as points, in your legend move the point symbol so that it is positioned on top of the appropriate line then delete any text that was associated with the symbol Add any extra text that you want to add by using the Text button on the ribbon, or remove text that you don\u2019t need The default legend styles in Arc will not necessarily group features in a way that is most helpful for your map. You can add headings yourself using the Text tool and then rearrange the entries under those headings manually Checking your legend/key Make sure that your key covers all of the information that you have added to your map, but doesn\u2019t include any symbology that doesn\u2019t appear on your map. Do you want your audience to waste time sitting there wondering where that symbol is on your map? Adding a measured grid Measured grids add labelled grid lines to a layout. If you are using Ordnance Survey or other UK data projected in British National Grid then you can easily add National Grid lines and numbers to your map. The O.S. raster tiff files already have grid lines marked, but adding a measured grid allows you to include coordinates around the edge of your map - making it possible to use grid coordinates to locate features on your map with grid references. Adding a measured grid to a map This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . To add a measured grid: With the map frame selected, from the Insert tab of the ribbon click on Grid You should be presented with a selection of choices. For a map in a projected coordinate system such as British National Grid you will want to choose one of the Measured Grids , and probably Black Vertical Label Grid You can make changes to the grid in the Format Map Grid pane to the right of the window when the Grid is selected in the Contents pane check that the intervals are suitable to the scale of map. You don\u2019t want the lines to be too dense, but you want to have enough to make it possible to see measurements between them. To change the intervals: In the Options tab untick Automatically adjust under Interval Go to the Components tab and change the intervals for Labels , Ticks and Gridlines Numeric grids Note that the grid Arc adds is fully numeric. You may be more used to seeing grid letters for 100 km grid squares on Ordnance Survey published maps, e.g. our current grid reference is similar to SE 2934 3444, but our current grid coordinates are similar to 42934 43444. It is the latter that will appear on a measured grid generated by Arc. For more information on this and a diagram to help you to change from one to the other see Adding north arrows Before adding a north arrow to your layout stop and think about how you need to indicate north on your map. If you look at the technical information on an Ordnance Survey Landranger (1:50 000) map you\u2019ll see a diagram showing Grid north, True north and Magnetic north. The information given there shows how to plot the difference of magnetic north from grid north. Adding this to your own maps can also be useful, particularly if you, or anyone else, are going to be using the map in the field. If you are taking strike and dip measurements in the field you should have corrected your compass-clino for declination (the horizontal angular difference between true north and magnetic north) anyway. When you plot the measurements on your map it isn\u2019t worth worrying too much about whether you are plotting against grid or true north as the difference on any grid, not just the British National Grid, is unlikely to be that big. If you add any north arrows to your layout do remember to label them in some way which shows which version of north each one is showing. You still need to add a label if you only add one type of north arrow. Adding north arrows to a layout This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . North arrow: Grid north / Map north If a map is in a projected coordinate system Arc will automatically lay it out aligned with the grid. So for example, any map set to British National Grid will be aligned to grid north . In this case it isn\u2019t strictly necessary to add a north arrow to show grid north if you also include a measured grid on your map, but it doesn\u2019t hurt. In layout view: From the Insert tab of the ribbon click on the down arrow under the North Arrow button select an arrow style (it\u2019s usually much better not to go for something too fancy!) Double-click on the arrow to open the Format North Arrow pane that opens to the right and check that Type is set to Map North If you check this against your measured grid lines you should find that it matches exactly. North arrow: True north True north is the direction from the area of your map to the North Pole. In the east/west centre of a grid, such as that set for the British National Grid, it may well be the same as grid north, e.g. in Leeds the difference is extremely slight. As you go further east or west towards the edges of the area covered by a grid the difference becomes more noticeable, e.g. at Lands End in Cornwall, or in Norfolk. The ArcGIS Pro Help describes True north as \u201cThe north arrow angle points to geodetic north (to the north pole) as calculated by the coordinate system of the associated map frame, at the center of the map.\u201d To add an arrow showing true north to your map, in layout view: From the Insert tab of the ribbon click on the down arrow under the North Arrow button Select an arrow style (it\u2019s usually much better not to go for something too fancy!) Double-click on the arrow to open the Format North Arrow pane to the right and check that Type is set to True North If you check this north arrow against your measured grid lines you may well find that the north arrow is slightly tilted. North arrow: Magnetic north calculated by grid magnetic angle Magnetic north is the direction from the area of your map to the magnetic North Pole. This is the number that is given on the corner of Ordnance Survey maps and the one geologists need for setting their compass-clinos in the field, so it is worth making a note of this on your map too. To set magnetic north automatically - in layout view: From the Insert tab of the ribbon click on the down arrow under the North Arrow button select an arrow style (it\u2019s usually much better not to go for something too fancy!) Double-click on the arrow to open the Format North Arrow pane to the right and check that Type is set to Magnetic North The properties will give the Calculated Angle . It\u2019s a good idea to add this and the current date to your magnetic north arrow as magnetic north changes with time. If you check this north arrow against your measured grid lines you will probably find that the north arrow is slightly tilted. Note that as of July 2020 the line where magnetic north and grid north are the same is passing across the UK so you may find that there is no, or very little difference 5 . Setting magnetic north manually Since version 2.4 of ArcGIS Pro setting a north arrow to magnetic north has become simple, but if you do need to work out the declination for yourself the BGS Geomagnetism Group web page will give you the calibration angle for anywhere in the world. Use the map to select your area and click to retrieve the data. Make a note of the figure shown as degrees east and round it to the nearest two decimal places. The key to the table you are given is underneath the map. If you need to set the angle manually with the declination from the site above, enter the value into the Calibration Angle box. Note that due to the way Arc calibrates the angle, if your figure is negative you need to add it as positive, if positive, put a minus sign in front of it! The arrow on the preview should change to reflect the magnetic angle. Adding extra map frames It can be very useful to be able to place more than one map or map view on a single layout, either so that you can show a different area, or a different zoom level for the same area. You can also use this to set up an automatic extent indicator which marks your study area on a larger map. To do all of this you need to add extra map frames. Adding extra map frames to a layout This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . Showing a different area of the same map If you just want to add another frame showing a different area of the same map and using the same data layers, then the process is simple and is basically repeating what you did to add the first map frame. Click on Map Frame on the Insert tab of the ribbon If you just click on the button you\u2019ll be given a World map If you click on the arrow underneath Map Frame you\u2019ll be given some options which include any spatial bookmarks that you have set up and the map views in your project Click on any of the options to add a new map frame to your layout. If you have a map showing the world you can zoom in to the area of your data You can move each map frame separately, but if you turn data layers on or off on one of them, they will be turned on or off on both. Create a new map frame using different data Adding another map frame which uses different data layers is a bit more involved but does open up many more possibilities. Start by setting up another map - from the Insert tab of the ribbon click on New Map It\u2019s a good idea to rename the maps so that you can remember what each one shows. Do this by bringing up the Map Properties and changing the Name field Set this map up with the data you need 6 and symbolise as required then return to your layout Click on Map Frame on the Insert tab of the ribbon If you just click on the button you\u2019ll be given a World map If you click on the arrow underneath Map Frame you\u2019ll be given some options which include any spatial bookmarks that you have set up and the map views in your project Click on any of the options to add a map frame to your layout. If you have a map showing the World you can zoom in to the area of your data. Adding an extent indicator For some maps, particularly large scale (detailed) maps of very small areas, it is useful to show a small scale map of the general area with the area of the main map marked. To do this you need to obtain small scale data and then add it to a second map frame in Arc. You really only need a general map, even just an outline of a whole country, so it can be best to use data from Natural Earth 7 . Note that using a screenshot from Google Maps or Google Earth (or similar) with a marker on it doesn\u2019t look good and should be avoided. Not least it is surprisingly easy to end up with the marker in the wrong place. The example in the picture below shows an extent indicator on a layout which uses a smaller map to show the general area of the main map. In this example the main map has been duplicated and shrunk down, but set to cover the same extent as the main map. The extent is then shown on an outline map of the UK. You can also make the extent straight from the larger map. Note that the indicator does not need to be large, but should be a small map which doesn\u2019t take up too much space on the layout. Start by adding a new map frame to your map and add your choice of map layers, e.g. the Natural Earth Data countries, to the new map and symbolise appropriately. Set up the extent indicator To set up the extent function: Resize and relocate the new map frame and set it to an appropriate scale (e.g. start with 1:1 000 000) or the area of the country of your main map. Select the outline map (the one that is going to be the extent indicator) Click on Extent Indicator on the Insert tab of the ribbon From the dropdown select the map frame of the more detailed map that you want the extent indicator to show the area for Arc should add a dot to the map at the correct location. You can now use the Format Extent Indicator pane on the right to set the properties, e.g. try changing the symbol, or use the dropdown under Leader and try out the options there You should now have a map with a marker showing the area covered by your main map and with a line or lines leading to it as in the image above. If you use a smaller map, as in the example, select that map, and in the Format Map Frame pane choose Linked map frame extent under Constraint so that it continues to show the same area as the main map. Change the size and scale of your extent indicator Try moving and rescaling both maps (remember that you have to Activate the frame you want to pan and zoom in) - the marker on the extent indicator should resize and relocate to reflect your changes. You can change the style of the box and the leader line by selecting the correct extent indicator under Extent Indicators in the contents page, then editing the properties in the Format Extent Indicator pane on the right. Inserting photographs and images To insert photographs or images, such as a digitised cross-section, into your map layout: In a layout select Picture from the graphics group of the Insert tab on the ribbon Click on your layout and then browse for the image you want in the dialog that opens Move the image on the page as required. Try not to resize it unless you absolutely have to. You\u2019ll get much better quality if you resize vector images in Inkscape / CorelDraw / Adobe Illustrator before you export them, rather than resizing them in Arc once they\u2019ve been saved as rasters For photographs try to resize using a photo editing program such as The Gimp, Photoshop or Paintshop Pro Image formats for importing Following some experimentation I would recommend that if you are including diagrams produced either in CorelDraw or Inkscape you Export/save as... your diagram as png format and then insert the resulting file into Arc. It may not look quite right on screen (gradients can be a bit odd and the image can look very pixelated/blurry) but looks fine when actually printed. Jpg files tended to have problems with colours changing, particularly when exported from CorelDraw. If the image doesn\u2019t look quite right, try exporting to pdf or printing a copy of your layout before you worry about it ( ). What you see on screen isn\u2019t always how the final result will look. Checking your map A very important stage, but one that can easily be forgotten if you are in a hurry! In addition to the points below have a look at Darkes (2017) 8 which gives a lot of quick tips on map layout and presentation. On pages 92 and 93 Darkes includes a section with quick wins for improving your map before publication if you have 5, 15 or 50 minutes. In addition check the reading list for other references - there is plenty of information available to help you to present better maps. Check spelling. Even better - get a helpful (and reliable!) friend to proof-read your text for spelling mistakes. It can be very easy to miss something obvious in your own work. In particular check geological and geographical names and any technical terms. Check that you have included everything that you need to include. If this is an assignment reread the instructions and check that you haven\u2019t forgotten to do anything. Check that your map doesn\u2019t include anything that you don\u2019t want to include! Did you add some experimental polygons when you were editing, then forget to delete them? Have you clicked on the Add text button too many times, but then not removed the resulting text? Look at the article on Using a mapmaking checklist for map design . Read about what makes a map great, then click on the link to the checklist and use the questions there to evaluate your own map. Printing a copy to pdf to check Inevitably you\u2019ll notice something not quite right with your map after you have printed it. To minimize the chances of this happening when the (expensive) full-sized colour version is printed it is a good idea to print your map at A3 and have a close look at it first! (This isn\u2019t such an issue if your map is only A3 or A4 when full size.) Export your map as a pdf file following the instructions in the section on Printing and exporting maps from Arc . Open your pdf map file in Arcrobat reader, or your usual pdf program (instructions below are for Acrobat) File > Print Choose your printer and use the printer properties to set the paper size to A3 then choose to print in colour In the Page Handling section set Page Scaling to Fit to Printable Area . In Acrobat this should show you a small preview of how your file will print When you are happy with the settings - OK Once you have collected the printed copy have a good look at it to check that everything looks as you expect it to. Printing and exporting maps from Arc When you have finished creating your map in ArcGIS you will usually need to export it to pdf for printing. The following instructions should help to ensure that your map is the correct size and scale. Printing a map from Arc The best quality is usually obtained by printing directly from Arc, though this isn\u2019t always possible. If it is, print as follows: Start by checking that the page size and scale are correct Whilst in a layout go to the Share tab of the ribbon and click on the Print icon Set up the printer as you usually would (this is system specific so I can\u2019t include exact instructions here) then click to print Exporting a map for printing These instructions show you how to export the map to pdf - the format that is usually required by print shops etc. There are other options, such as png, in the dropdown list if you need to export an image, maybe to include in a Word document, and the instructions are very similar. Whilst in a layout go to the Share tab of the ribbon and click on the Export icon Select PDF(*.pdf) in the Save as type. Do not select the Production PDF option, if you have it - it causes all sorts of problems. Set the resolution - minimum 300dpi for printing. Higher is better, but too high and it will be impossible to export the file, particularly if it is a large map. Set Image Quality to Best Give you file a name and choose where to save it (checking first that you have enough disk space - some exported maps can be very large! 9 ) Export - be patient! For a large map this can take a long time. Printing your final copy If you are printing a map that has to be at a particular scale, e.g. for a 1:10 000 field slip or top copy map, when you print your map from pdf double-check in the pdf reader you use that the Page scaling or Zoom is set to Actual Size... or None (the actual terminology depends on which pdf application you are printing from). This is important to ensure that your map is printed at the scale at which you intend it to be printed. Major problems can be caused by the tiny amount that your map will be reduced by otherwise. Exporting a map to import to other programs You can also export the Arc layout to include in programs such as Inkscape, CorelDraw, Word or Powerpoint. The instructions here show how to export for Word or Powerpoint. To start with set up your Arc layout as required Check that the page size, and the scale/size of the map frame are correct - you\u2019ll lose quality if you resize them outside of Arc If you want to include a legend in the final layout it is a good idea to create it in Arc and export it with the map as then the colours and sizes of the symbols will match the map Export the map using the instructions on Exporting a map for printing , but this time choose the appropriate output format (see below) and set the resolution - to 600dpi if you have the disk space Choose a location then Export Image formats for export If you basically want a good quality image to import into Word, Powerpoint, CorelDraw, Inkscape etc, then png or jpg are both fine. Be aware that if you import png or jpg and then resize them you are likely to end up with a blurred final result - double-check before printing. You import pdf or svg into Inkscape and CorelDraw and do some further editing. Whichever format you choose, if your map is going to be part of a bigger presentation where scale is important, such as the Geology final dissertation map, import to either Inkscape or CorelDraw without changing scale/size/proportions (check instructions for these programs) and then double-check the scale of the main map by checking it against the lines of the measured grid. For example, for a map at 1:10 000, a line of 10 cm will be the same length as the space between the 1000 m (1 km) grid lines. Suggested final map layout The figure below shows a suggested layout for your final map. Once you have finished working through this chapter you will be able to pick the most appropriate elements to add to your maps. This is the stage where you present your map in the clearest possible way so that your audience can \u201cread\u201d the information that you are trying to give to them. Try setting your map up on an A3 layout rather than the A4 shown here. It will give you more space to try things out. Remember too, don\u2019t be afraid of white space, so don\u2019t make elements larger just to fill the space available to you. Your map should not look identical to this as you will have made your own decisions as to what to include and where to put the elements. For example, you could add a small extent indicator to this to show where Ingleton is located within the UK; you could add a north arrow (remember to give the details if you do); you should include your name, or at least Student ID, as the creator of the map.

These acknowledgements do change from time to time so it\u2019s worth knowing how to check the requirement for yourself: To find these copyright acknowledgements go to the Digimap Resource Centre ( Resources at the top of the main Digimap page) Look for a link to Digimap Licence Agreements and click on it Click on the End User or Sub-licence agreement for the data that you\u2019ve used then look for the information under In return, you must: - that gives you the acknowledgement text For example, as of April 2019, when you use Ordnance Survey data obtained from Digimap you are expected to add the following text to your map 3 : \u00a9 Crown copyright and database rights year . Ordnance Survey (100025252). Where year is replaced by the current year. Remember that you do have to acknowledge each different dataset that you use and will have signed up to that when you registered. Finding copyright acknowledgements Use the instructions above to find the correct copyright acknowledgement for British Geological Survey data downloaded from the Digimap Geology collection. Is it the same as the Ordnance Survey acknowledgement? If you are not using U.K. Ordnance Survey data this is not the correct copyright acknowledgement to use, for example, if you are using data for Spain or the United States, or indeed any UK data that you haven\u2019t downloaded from Digimap. You\u2019ll need to find the correct copyright acknowledgement for yourself. There is an article on GIS Lounge about How to cite GIS materials which you may find useful. It explains about citing the software as well as the data. Digimap also provide advice on citing Digimap data , as opposed to the copyright acknowledgement.","title":"Copyright acknowledgements"},{"location":"layout/#adding-a-key-legend-to-your-layout","text":"You\u2019ll have added various data to your map, and it is necessary for you to explain to anyone looking at your map what those layers and symbols show.

The information given there shows how to plot the difference of magnetic north from grid north. Adding this to your own maps can also be useful, particularly if you, or anyone else, are going to be using the map in the field. If you are taking strike and dip measurements in the field you should have corrected your compass-clino for declination (the horizontal angular difference between true north and magnetic north) anyway. When you plot the measurements on your map it isn\u2019t worth worrying too much about whether you are plotting against grid or true north as the difference on any grid, not just the British National Grid, is unlikely to be that big. If you add any north arrows to your layout do remember to label them in some way which shows which version of north each one is showing.

Over the course of several weeks lateral blasts from the eruption destroyed the forested slopes and the volcano covered a large area in lava and ash. The USGS has a downloadable file with more information about the eruption . The Cascades Volcano Observatory has a lot more information and images of Mount St. Helens, including sections on hazards, monitoring, geology and history. In this exercise we\u2019ll use the tools in ArcGIS Pro to investigate the changes in the shape of the mountain caused by the eruption. We\u2019ll use USGS (United States Geological Survey) height data measured before and after the eruption, as well as the height data provided by ESRI within ArcGIS Pro. Obtaining the data for this exercise Download the MtStHelens.7z file from Minerva. Save it to your file space and unzip it. The data for this exercise has been obtained from SERC Carlton teaching resources . The data can also be found on the webpages of the Geomorphological Research Group at University of Washington The exercises are based on worksheets from the above URL and from ESRI Canada. Setting up the map project The zip file that you have downloaded and unzipped should include a file called MtStHelens.aprx . Open this now 1 and you should see that there isn\u2019t yet data on the map. If you check the map properties you should be able to see that the project has already been set up to use the correct coordinate system. in this case NAD 1983 UTM Zone 10N . NAD = North American Datum and UTM = Universal Transverse Mercator 2 . I\u2019ve changed the map name to show the coordinate system - this can be a very useful thing to do if you\u2019re likely to need to keep track of it throughout your project. Add the hbefore and hafter files to the map from Folders > MtStHelens > Data section in the contents pane. Switch the layers on and off to have a look at the changes between the before and after shapes as they are visible at the moment. These are raster layers where each pixel contains the elevation of the land at that point. Symbolising the raster layers At the moment the height layers, the rasters that you have just added, will be coloured the default shades of grey. There are other colour ramps available which will make the elevation clearer. Select the hbefore layer in the contents pane go to the Appearance tab of the ribbon and click on Symbology In the symbology dialog check that the Primary Symbology is set to Stretch drop down the list of choices next to Color scheme , click on Show names at the bottom, then select Elevation #1 from the list Click on the dropdown next to Stretch type and select Minimum Maximum to use the full range of values in your raster. Your settings should look something like the image below. Set symbology for after Repeat the process above to symbolise the hafter elevation raster file. You have on your map two layers which show similar data and which you may want to compare. To do this it would be useful to have the symbology, and also the legend later, set to the same scale. At the moment: hbefore = 669 to 2951 hafter = 682 to 2543 To put both elevation maps onto the same scale do the following: select the hbefore layer in the contents and go to the symbology panel below the other settings there is a panel for Statistics Drop down the Statistics options and choose Custom The Min and Max boxes below should become editable Change the Min to a round number which is less than the minimum of either dataset, e.g. 600 Change the Max to a round number which is greater than the maximum of either dataset, e.g. 3000 You should notice a change in the symbology of the layer. For some reason, the contents list will still give the same min and max, though. So to update the legend and contents do the following: in the Primary Symbology box above change the values in the boxes to your minimum and maximum values. Changing the default symbology Repeat the above with the habove layer - putting the same minimum and maximum values. If you look at both layers on your map now you should be able to see the difference between before and after the eruption more clearly. Creating hillshading It is possible to see from the height files that you have already added to your map some differences in the before and after topography, but they do not give a very clear view. Hillshades can give a much clearer picture of the topography of an area (and incidentally can give a better idea of the quality of your height data). Geoprocessing > 3D Analyst Tools > Surface > Hillshade Fill in the dialog with hbefore as the input. Select where you want to save the input and give it a name. Leave the other fields as they are for now. Click Run . The tool should run and add a new layer to your map. The resulting layer should show the shape of the land more visibly than the original raster layer. Hillshade Repeat the hillshade process with the hafter raster file. Have a look at both hillshade layers. The difference in the shape of Mount St. Helens before the eruption and after should be becoming clearer. Hillshade light source Incidentally, notice that the light source on the hillshade layer comes from the top-left of the image - which is usually the north-west, a direction from which the sun very rarely shines. This direction gives the best effect of 3D for an image. If you try turning a hillshaded map upside down so that the sun comes from the south-east, very often valleys will look like hills and hills will look like valleys. Symbolising the hillshade You could symbolise the hillshade directly to make a \u201cprettier\u201d map, but you often get a better result by symbolising the DEM (height data), then putting the hillshade underneath it and making the DEM something like 40% transparent. Make the \u201cafter\u201d layers invisible (turn them off in the contents list) and try symbolising the \u201cbefore\u201d layers first. If you haven\u2019t already, symbolise the hbefore height layer with a stretched colour ramp and set it to 40% transparency on the Appearance tab . Now try turning the hillshade layer on and off and have a look at how much difference it makes to how you can perceive the landscape. If you still have the World Hillshade and Topographic Map layers on your map from the ESRI basemap you\u2019ll also see who those interact with your data. Try turning those off and on too. Symbolising the hillshade Try the same with the \u201cafter\u201d layers to symbolise those with the hillshade. As usual - experiment! Area and volume calculations It\u2019s good to be able to look at the differences on a map, but what about actually doing some measurements and getting some figures out of the data? Arc\u2019s toolbox gives us the tools to be able to calculate the volume of Mount St. Helens before and after the eruption. If you don\u2019t have the toolbox open already find it by going to the Analysis ribbon and clicking on Tools Geoprocessing > 3D Analyst Tools > Functional Surface > Surface Volume Fill in the dialog with hbefore as the input. Don\u2019t worry about saving the output this time - you\u2019ll make a note of it from the results window The Reference Plane controls how the volume is measured to see more click on the question mark symbol at the top of the tool dialog - the appropriate help page should open in your browser. In this case the page shows you the difference between setting the reference plane to either above or below. Return to Arc and set the Reference Plane to Above the Plane Having set this it is also a good idea to set the Plane Height . In this case set it to 669 , which is the lowest elevation in the hbefore DEM - check the contents pane to find this. Finally click on Run Don\u2019t close the panel when the tool finishes running. Instead use the output window, which you can find by clicking on View Details at the bottom of the processing tool, to make a note of the results. Results of area and volume calculations - Before Make a note of the following results for the Before layer 2D area 3D area 3 Volume The results will be in map units . Check the units by going to the map properties and checking the General tab. In this case it should be metres. Repeat the process for hafter , leaving the Plane Height as 699 , and again make a note of the results. Results of area and volume calculations - After Make a note of the following results for the Before layer 2D area 3D area Volume Have a look at the two sets of results and compare them. Looking at your results What differences are there? What can you say about the change in area/volume before and after the eruption? Profile graphs Another way to view topography is to draw a profile. This will allow you to see a profile of the land surface along a line, and in this case allows you to view profiles for before and after the eruption. Start by creating a new line feature class in the project geodatabase, making sure that the coordinate system matches the one used for the map, and drawing a line from north to south across the DEM. From the Analysis ribbon click on Tools and go to the Interpolate Shape tool via Geoprocessing > 3D Analyst Tools > Functional Surface > Interpolate Shape Fill in the dialog as follows: The Input surface should be the Before DEM Input Features is the line across the DEM that you have just drawn Give your Output Feature Class a name which reminds you that it is based on the Before layer The other defaults are fine so click the Run button You will have created a new line feature class which should be added to your map. If it isn\u2019t, then drag it across from the Catalog to the Contents pane. At this stage your map won\u2019t look much different. To create the profile: Select the new Before section line in the Contents and right-click on it Create Chart > Profile Graph Arc should open a new panel below your map which contains the resulting profile across the Before DEM. If you click on Properties at the top of the panel you can change the format and title, as well as other items. By clicking on Export you can save the profile graph as a graphics file, e.g. svg (which can then be opened in Inkscape), png or jpg (both of which can be added to Word and Powerpoint documents). Profile across the After DEM Repeat the process to create a profile graph for the DEM showing the height After the eruption. Once you have created a graph it is listed in the Contents pane under the layer to which it applies. If you close it, you can open it again by clicking on the appropriate graph in the Contents. Comparing the graphs Have a look at both of the graphs you have created. Resize them and use the properties to give them appropriate titles and axis labels. Viewing your map in 3D Within Arc it is possible to view your maps in 3D by creating a Scene . We\u2019ll look at this now with the data you have already, but it\u2019s something you can do with any data that you create in future too. Viewing your map in 3D in ArcGIS Pro This video clip can be found in the module area of Minerva or in the full list of video clips . Creating a Scene To set up an empty scene within your existing Mount St. Helen\u2019s project. Go to the Insert tab of the ribbon Click on the down arrow under the New Map button Click on New Local Scene Arc will create a new screen which currently looks very much like a new map - see the picture below. Note that the new scene appears under the Maps subheading in the Catalog. In the Contents pane the Drawing Order view now shows layers divided into 3D Layers and 2D Layers . Adding layers to a scene You can add layers to a scene in exactly the same way as adding them to a map. Find your hillshade layers in your catalog pane and drag and drop them into the scene You should find that your scene zooms to the correct location for Mount St Helens and you can view the hillshade layers. Navigating in a scene ArcGIS Pro Help has full information on how to navigate in 3D . The main difference from navigating in a map is that you can use the mouse wheel to \u201ctip up\u201d the map and rotate it, or use the navigation tool at the bottom left of the map to move around. Try this now. Move around the map and view it from various different angles. It should quickly become obvious that the hillshade layers are draped over the landscape as it is now. For now, turn off both hillshade layers so that you can see the basemap. Changing the background layer You can also change the Basemap in exactly the same way as you can change it in a map. Changing the basemap Change the basemap to Imagery now and use the navigation tools to zoom in to Mount St Helens so that you can view the scene from a lower angle. Controlling the elevation surface You\u2019ll notice that Arc sets a default elevation surface - i.e. data which controls the terrain or 3D surface. It is possible to make changes to this, and indeed to set your own elevation surface. To change any of the properties of the elevation surface: select Ground under the Elevation Surfaces heading at the bottom of the contents panel Click on the Appearance tab on the ribbon to get the properties for the elevation surface. Vertical exaggeration The default vertical exaggeration is 1.0 - which basically means as is reality. Whilst scientifically this is usually the best setting to use, sometimes you need to exaggerate the terrain to make it easier to visualise useful information. In the Scene Appearance tab, change Vertical Exaggeration to 4.0 You\u2019ll probably need to be patient again while the Scene redraws, then zoom outwards so that you can see Mount St Helens again! The difference between an exaggeration of 1.0 and an exaggeration of 4.0 should be pretty clear. Adding a custom elevation surface Sometimes it is more useful to see your own data as the elevation surface. For example, we can add the DEM showing the shape of Mount St Helens before the 1980 eruption. right-click on Ground under the Elevation Surfaces heading at the bottom of the contents panel Add Elevation Source and navigate to the data folder to select the hbefore raster dataset then click OK This may look a bit odd as you\u2019ll still have the ESRI Imagery layer showing the current land surface, but the crater at the top of Mount St Helens should apparently have been filled in. Try turning on the hillshade layer showing the before data. If you add a custom elevation surface, but leave the World Elevation layer on, then areas ouside of your DEM will still have elevation. Turn off the before layers for both hillshade and the elevation surface before continuing with the next section. Alternative elevation surfaces The elevation surface doesn\u2019t have to be the same as the land surface. For example, instead you could use a surface showing the top surface of a particular rock unit underground; average annual rainfall; lead pollution in soils. Cut-fill analysis Cut-fill analysis looks at how much material is lost or gained in an area by comparing two surface models - one before the change, and one after. It could be used to look at deposition in a lake or changes in groundwater over time, for example. Here we\u2019ll use it to visualise the difference in land surface before and after the 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens. On the Analysis ribbon click on Tools in the Geoprocessing toolbox go to 3D Analyst Tools > Raster Surface > Cut Fill Fill in the dialog as follows (see image below): For Input before Raster Surface use the folder button on the right to select the before DEM For Input after Raster Surface use the folder button on the right to select the after DEM Give the Output raster a name you\u2019ll remember and choose to save it in one of the folders in your project Click on Run The results should look something like the image below. The key underneath shows what the different colours indicate. The red areas show a net gain, the blue a net loss, any grey areas would be unchanged. This layer could complement the volume measurements that you gained in the section on Area and volume calculations . Including a scene in a layout It is possible to include your scene in a layout in exactly the same way that you can include a map. From within a layout: Click on the arrow underneath the Map Frame button on the Insert tab of the ribbon In the list that appears choose a Scene then wait a while for it to appear on your layout! You can move the scene around and resize it on the layout in exactly the same way that you can move and resize a map frame . If you want to change the view then you need to right-click on the Map Frame which contains your scene and Activate , exactly as you would for a flat map Once you\u2019ve done this you can use the usual 3D navigation tools to move the view around When you\u2019ve finished, click on Layout at the top left of the layout to return to the layout view You can export or print the layout in the usual way. Exporting a 3D view Once you have a useful view in a Scene you can export it as an image to import into other programs, such as Inkscape, Word or Powerpoint, without having to set up a layout to do so. Go to the Share tab of the ribbon Click on the Map button in the Export group choose where you want to save the output, and what format you want ( png or jpg will import into Word or Powerpoint) Check the Resolution - higher gives better quality, but a bigger file. Experiment, but don\u2019t go higher than 600 without being very careful. 300 is usually enough. Click Export Other suggestions for analysis Arc contains a large number of tools for working with data. Try out some of the following and think about how you could use them with other datasets. If you are not sure what information you need to enter in a particular field in a tool dialog click on information symbol which comes up when you hover over a field. That will give you a brief explanation. If you are still stuck then try clicking on the question mark at the top of the tool and you should be taken to the full information in online Help. Creating contours Try creating height contours for the before and after DEMs of Mount St. Helens Hint: Geoprocessing > 3D Analyst Tools > Raster Surface > Contour This can be very useful if you have a DEM but no contours and want to create a base map for mapping. You can also use this to create contours for other data surfaces, such as soil samples, rainfall etc. Viewshed analysis Viewshed analysis shows which parts of a scene an observer at a particular point would be able to see. Try creating a point feature class and placing a point somewhere on the map of Mount St. Helens. Then go to Geoprocessing > 3D Analyst Tools > Visibility > Viewshed Slope and aspect Both of these tools produce an output raster. Slope shows the angle of slope of steepness of each part of the map. A slope map of Mount St. Helens could indicate which areas are most vulnerable to a landslip. Aspect shows in which direction the slope is facing. Both are under Geoprocessing > 3D Analyst Tools > Raster Surface Layout suggestions You have created a lot of output in this exercise. Try and think about ways in which you can create an attractive layout showing the effect of the 1980 eruption on the shape of Mount St. Helens. Try putting together a layout that includes the before and after hillshades symbolised with the DEMs. Include a 3D view of the scene in your layout Include before and after profiles taken across the same line from north to south Add an extent rectangle making use of an outline country map from naturalearthdata.com . Show the location of Mount St. Helens within the United States. Your final map could look something like the map below. It is unlikely to look identical as you should make your own decisions about where to place elements and how to display the data that you have produced.

If you try turning a hillshaded map upside down so that the sun comes from the south-east, very often valleys will look like hills and hills will look like valleys.","title":"Creating hillshading"},{"location":"three_d/#symbolising-the-hillshade","text":"You could symbolise the hillshade directly to make a \u201cprettier\u201d map, but you often get a better result by symbolising the DEM (height data), then putting the hillshade underneath it and making the DEM something like 40% transparent. Make the \u201cafter\u201d layers invisible (turn them off in the contents list) and try symbolising the \u201cbefore\u201d layers first. If you haven\u2019t already, symbolise the hbefore height layer with a stretched colour ramp and set it to 40% transparency on the Appearance tab . Now try turning the hillshade layer on and off and have a look at how much difference it makes to how you can perceive the landscape. If you still have the World Hillshade and Topographic Map layers on your map from the ESRI basemap you\u2019ll also see who those interact with your data. Try turning those off and on too.

In this case the page shows you the difference between setting the reference plane to either above or below. Return to Arc and set the Reference Plane to Above the Plane Having set this it is also a good idea to set the Plane Height . In this case set it to 669 , which is the lowest elevation in the hbefore DEM - check the contents pane to find this. Finally click on Run Don\u2019t close the panel when the tool finishes running.

This will allow you to see a profile of the land surface along a line, and in this case allows you to view profiles for before and after the eruption. Start by creating a new line feature class in the project geodatabase, making sure that the coordinate system matches the one used for the map, and drawing a line from north to south across the DEM. From the Analysis ribbon click on Tools and go to the Interpolate Shape tool via Geoprocessing > 3D Analyst Tools > Functional Surface > Interpolate Shape Fill in the dialog as follows: The Input surface should be the Before DEM Input Features is the line across the DEM that you have just drawn Give your Output Feature Class a name which reminds you that it is based on the Before layer The other defaults are fine so click the Run button You will have created a new line feature class which should be added to your map. If it isn\u2019t, then drag it across from the Catalog to the Contents pane. At this stage your map won\u2019t look much different. To create the profile: Select the new Before section line in the Contents and right-click on it Create Chart > Profile Graph Arc should open a new panel below your map which contains the resulting profile across the Before DEM. If you click on Properties at the top of the panel you can change the format and title, as well as other items. By clicking on Export you can save the profile graph as a graphics file, e.g. svg (which can then be opened in Inkscape), png or jpg (both of which can be added to Word and Powerpoint documents).

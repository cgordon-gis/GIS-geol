<p>The background to using GIS for analysis will be covered in the lecture segment at the beginning of the class, and the presentation and any other supporting materials will be available in Minerva.  The lecture segment should help you to understand <strong>why</strong> you are doing these exercises.  If you still aren&rsquo;t sure, please ask <a href="mailto:c.e.gordon@leeds.ac.uk">Clare</a>.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning outcomes</h2>
<p>When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>demonstrate how to select and analyse point sampled spatial data</li>
<li>select appropriate tools to carry out geoprocessing tasks</li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO: Learning outcomes for analysis chapter -->

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The glen of the River Cononish near Tyndrum in Scotland has historically been a lead and gold mining area. Using data from stream and soil samples we will look at ways of processing and displaying point sampled data in ArcGIS to investigate possible lead contamination.</p>
<!-- TODO: could I add a link to info about Cononish mining? -->

<p><img alt="River Cononish.  Ben Lui dominates the view ahead." src="../images/analysis/Cononish_small.jpg" title="River Cononish.  Ben Lui dominates the view ahead." /></p>
<!-- TODO: any other examples of analysis? -->

<p>The techniques in this chapter will give you an introduction to carrying out analysis in GIS and can be used for a wide variety of data, not just the geochemical data that we use here.</p>
<h2 id="data-to-download">Data to download</h2>
<h3 id="geochemical-data">Geochemical data</h3>
<p>You will create the map yourself, but the data, which consists of a spreadsheet and a shapefile which outlines the study area, can be downloaded from Minerva.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download <code>CononishData.zip</code> from Minerva.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data was collected as part of a student project in 2009 and is presented as an Excel spreadsheet which gives you details of the locations of the stream and soil samples and the lead concentration (in parts per million - ppm) in each sample.  The spreadsheet has been cleaned up to make it possible to import it into GIS.</p>
<h3 id="map-data-from-digimap">Map data from Digimap</h3>
<p>Using <strong><a href="/finding_data/#downloading-data-from-digimap">Digimap OS Download</a></strong> download the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS 1:25 000 Raster for at least the area shown in the image below.  You should search for <code>Cononish</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The minimum area for which to download data from Digimap OS Download." src="../images/analysis/ConProfileArea1.png" title="The minimum area for which to download data from Digimap OS Download." /></p>
<h2 id="setting-up-your-map">Setting up your map</h2>
<p>You will set up this map from scratch.  If you can&rsquo;t remember how to do this refer back to the <a href="/finding_data/#starting-a-new-map-project">instructions in the chapter on Finding data and adding it to Arc</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open ArcGIS Pro and create a new project called <code>Cononish</code></li>
<li>Move the files that you downloaded from Minerva into the project folder and make sure that you have unzipped them.</li>
<li>Move the files that you downloaded from Digimap into the project folder and make sure that you have unzipped them.</li>
<li>Add the <code>1:25 000 raster</code> tile(s) from Digimap to your map.</li>
<li>It is a good idea to <a href="/finding_data/#checking-the-coordinate-system-of-your-map">check that the coordinate system of your map has been set to British National Grid</a>.<ul>
<li>It probably won&rsquo;t have been set as the 1:25 000 raster data doesn&rsquo;t have the coordinate system set, so adding this layer to the map first doesn&rsquo;t change it to British National Grid.</li>
<li>So set the coordinate system of the map to <code>British National Grid</code> now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the ESRI base map to check that the 1:25 000 raster layer is in the correct place</li>
<li>Then it is also a good idea to <a href="/introduction/#remove-layers">remove</a> the default ESRI base map layers, which in a new project are usually the World Topographic Map and the World Hillshade.  These can cause your map to slow down and/or crash.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="importing-xy-data">Importing xy data</h2>
<!-- TODO: Do I already have a video clip for importing Excel data? -->

<p>The next thing we will do is to add the data from the Excel file to Arc.  This is a form of what can be called <strong>xy data</strong> because the file contains the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates for locations as well as other data.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already, download the <code>CononishData.zip</code> file from Minerva, unzip it into the project folder</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Excel spreadsheet, <code>XYZ_Pb.xls</code>, to have a look at the data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preparing-the-spreadsheet">Preparing the spreadsheet</h3>
<p>You have a file which includes grid references for the British National Grid (these are the columns headed <code>Gridref</code>, <code>eastings</code> and <code>northings</code>) and lead concentrations from soil and stream samples in parts per million (ppm) (the column headed <code>Pb_conc</code>).</p>
<p><img alt="The first few rows of the spreadsheet showing the location and concentration of the samples." src="../images/analysis/XYZpbSpreadsheetOrig_small.png" title="The first few rows of the spreadsheet showing the location and concentration of the samples." /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/svg/warning-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Warning</strong></p>
<p>Note that column headings must be short and contain no spaces or non-standard characters if you want to import a spreadsheet into Arc.  So text, numbers and underscore characters only.  Have a look at your table and edit it before importing into Arc to check that this is the case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In particular notice the <code>eastings</code> and <code>northings</code> columns which show the grid reference.  These are in <strong>British National Grid 1 m coordinates</strong>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll need to do some work to make these suitable for importing into Arc.  If you import the spreadsheet as it is these coordinates will leave your data somewhere in the sea south west of Cornwall.</p>
<p>Note the column <code>Gridref</code> - that tells you which 100 km grid square the references are in, <code>NN</code> in this case.  Unfortunately Arc won&rsquo;t read these so you need to convert the references.</p>
<h4 id="british-national-grid-100-km-squares">British National Grid 100 km squares</h4>
<p>British National Grid references are most commonly given in the form NN6005,2674, with grid <strong>letters</strong> at the start to give the 100 km grid square.  These letters need to be replaced by numbers if the grid references are to be read by ArcGIS.</p>
<p>If you are given a reference that does not include the grid letters but consists entirely of numbers it is worth checking whether the grid numbers make sense.  Of course, it may just mean that the person who created the references forgot about the letters, in this case the reference could refer to any of the 100 km squares covering the UK - not helpful!</p>
<h5 id="replacing-100-km-grid-letters-with-numbers">Replacing 100 km grid letters with numbers</h5>
<p>Follow the example below, then have a go for yourself with the examples provided.</p>
<p><img alt="British National Grid 100 km grid squares." src="../images/analysis/BNG_small.png" title="British National Grid 100 km grid squares." /></p>
<p>Using the example <strong>SK 6005 2674</strong> (note that this is not Cononish)</p>
<ul>
<li>find the number of the line <strong>to the left</strong> of the grid square in the image above (i.e. one of the numbers from the line at the bottom of the map) - for <strong>SK</strong> this is &ldquo;400&rdquo; - so write it down as <code>4</code>.</li>
<li>This number will apply to all of the references in the eastings column of the spreadsheet</li>
<li>then find the number of the line <strong>below</strong> the grid square (i.e. one of the numbers to the left of the map) - in this case &ldquo;300&rdquo; - so write it down as <code>3</code></li>
<li>This number will apply to all of the references in the northings column of the spreadsheet</li>
</ul>
<p>So in this example grid reference <strong>SK 6005 2674</strong> will become <strong>46005 32674</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition x and y numbers all need to be <strong>six figures</strong> to appear in the correct location on a map in Arc, so if, as in the example, there are fewer digits then add zeros to the end of each to make it correct.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally the grid reference above will become <code>460050 326740</code> and at this stage will be ready to enter into Arc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Instruction" src="../images/svg/create-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Practice converting grid letters to numbers</strong></p>
<p>Using the instructions above convert the following grid references to British National Grid numbers with 6 figures for each half (12 in total) so that Arc will be able to read them.  Answers are in the footnotes<sup id="fnref:504"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:504">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>1 - NH 3395 3196 =</p>
<p>2 - SP 727 499 =</p>
<p>3 - TM 2753 3952 =</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you look at the corners of a published hardcopy Ordnance Survey map such as the Landranger (Pink covers) or Explorer (Orange covers) series you&rsquo;ll be able to see these numbers as small figures on the labels of the grid lines - only at the corners, though, not right around the edges.  The grid letters will appear in the corner of the published maps too.</p>
<h5 id="replacing-the-numbers-in-your-spreadsheet">Replacing the numbers in your spreadsheet</h5>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have many locations that you need to change then you can edit each one manually, but if you have many sample points this rapidly becomes a big job.  Try using the power of the spreadsheet to do this more efficiently.</p>
<p>Start by working out what numbers you need to replace the grid letters using the instructions above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your spreadsheet in Excel or similar</li>
<li>Give headings to two more columns to the right of the rest of the data - call them <code>x</code> and <code>y</code></li>
<li>Click in the first cell in the x column then go up to the Formula Bar at the top</li>
<li>Type <code>=(</code> in the Formula Bar then click on the first cell in the <code>easting</code> column, the reference of that cell should appear, e.g. <code>C2</code></li>
<li>Now type in the formula bar - <code>*10)+200000</code> (that&rsquo;s 5 zeros after the 2).  The first figure should be the number before the 5 zeros should be the one that you found when converting the grid letters</li>
<li>and press <code>Return</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Typing the function in the first cell." src="../images/analysis/ExcelFunctionBar_small.png" title="Typing the function in the first cell." /></p>
<p>The six figure reference for the x coordinate should appear in the cell. </p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat the above for the first cell in the <code>y</code> column using the <code>northing</code> column and the second number that you found.</li>
<li>Now select both of the cells that you&rsquo;ve just edited</li>
<li>Note the tiny square at the bottom right of the selection and use the mouse cursor to pull it down the other cells in those columns.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of the cells should autofill with the correct grid references.</p>
<p><img alt="The first few rows of the spreadsheet containing the location and concentration of the samples." src="../images/analysis/XYZpbSpreadsheet_small.png" title="The first few rows of the spreadsheet containing the location and concentration of the samples." /></p>
<p>Save your spreadsheet then close it and make sure that your Cononish map is open in Arc.</p>
<h3 id="converting-xls-or-csv-to-a-feature-class">Converting .xls or .csv to a feature class</h3>
<p>This works for either Excel files or csv<sup id="fnref:501"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:501">2</a></sup> files.  Indeed, <strong>if you are having trouble loading an Excel file</strong>, try saving it as csv in Excel<sup id="fnref:502"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:502">3</a></sup>, then import it to Arc using the same instructions below.  It often works much better than the Excel file.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the file in the Catalog pane in Arc</li>
<li>For an Excel spreadsheet<ul>
<li>click on the down arrow next to the Excel file to show the contents</li>
<li>you should be able to see at least one layer with a name which ends with a <code>$</code> sign - see image below</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The Excel spreadsheet in the Catalog.  You need the sub file with the dollar sign." src="../images/analysis/ExcelSpreadsheet.png" title="The Excel spreadsheet in the Catalog.  You need the sub file with the dollar sign." /></p>
<ul>
<li>For a csv file<ul>
<li>work with the file directly, there won&rsquo;t be layers underneath it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you add the file to Arc as it is, you won&rsquo;t be able to view it on a map.  Though <strong>you</strong> can see the grid references these don&rsquo;t mean anything to Arc at the moment.  To be able to view the data on a map you need to convert the table to a feature class.  As part of this process  you&rsquo;ll be telling Arc where to find the grid reference of each point so that it can place it on the map.</p>
<ul>
<li>in the Catalog pane right-click on the data sheet to be imported and go to <code>Export &gt; Table to point feature class...</code></li>
<li>This will open the geoprocessing pane, fill it in as follows, and as shown in the following image<ul>
<li>check that the correct data sheet is selected, if it isn&rsquo;t click on the folder icon next to <code>Input table</code> to find it</li>
<li>choose a location and name for the <code>Output Feature Class</code> - the best place is inside the project geodatabase.  Give the output a name that will remind you what it contains.</li>
<li>Fill in the <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> fields using the spreadsheet columns which show the coordinates in British National Grid, this is usually either <code>Eastings</code> and <code>Northings</code> or <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>.  If you&rsquo;re not sure, check your spreadsheet.  You don&rsquo;t need to worry about the Z field.</li>
<li>click on the icon next to <code>Coordinate System</code> and select <code>British National Grid</code> - you may need to search for it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Run</code> the tool</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Creating a feature class from an XY Table." src="../images/analysis/XYTableToPoint_small.png" title="Creating a feature class from an XY Table." /></p>
<p>The output feature class should be added to your map automatically.  If it isn&rsquo;t, in the Catalog browse to the location you chose to save it to and drag and drop it onto your map.</p>

<h3 id="reviewing-the-data">Reviewing the data</h3>
<p>As usual it is important to look at the data to see what it contains and check your attribute table against the spreadsheet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom in on the new layer with <code>Zoom to Layer</code> and look at the area it covers.  Each point is the location of a sample reading.  Do they look as you&rsquo;d expect from the image above?  If not, you might have entered the wrong x and y fields, or got them the wrong way round.</li>
<li>Zoom in further and have a look at the 1:25 000 map that you added first, particularly noting the locations of mines.</li>
<li>Open the attribute table and have a look at it.  How does it compare to the original Excel spreadsheet?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Instruction" src="../images/svg/create-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Highest and lowest values?</strong></p>

<p>Although this chapter is headed Analysis, getting your data into Arc and checking it is always a big part of any project.  Make sure you leave plenty of time to do these steps!</p>
<h2 id="symbolising-the-points">Symbolising the points</h2>
<p>Now that you have the points from the spreadsheet imported into Arc you can start symbolising them to visualise the data in a more user-friendly fashion.  This doesn&rsquo;t use a tool from the toolbox, but is an essential part of analysing your data.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start with the simplest way of showing different concentrations on the map - graduated point symbols.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <code>Pb Concentration</code> layer in the contents then go to the <code>Appearance</code> tab of the ribbon.</li>
<li>click on the down arrow under <code>Symbology</code> and choose <code>Graduated Symbols</code></li>
<li>The symbology pane should open to the right of your map</li>
<li>set the <code>Field</code> to <code>concentration</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The resulting symbols should vary in size depending on the lead concentration at that sample point.</p>
<p><img alt="Lead concentrations at sample points symbolised as graduated sizes." src="../images/analysis/GraduatedSymbols.png" title="Lead concentrations at sample points symbolised as graduated sizes." /></p>
<ul>
<li>Try changing some of the other options on the symbology pane, such as the number of classes or the symbol.</li>
<li>Try different <code>Methods</code> of classifying the data, such as <code>Quantile</code> or <code>Equal Interval</code>.</li>
<li>Each time have a look at the changes on the map and think about how this shows the range of your data.</li>
<li>In addition try setting the symbology type to <code>Proportional Symbols</code> rather than Graduated Symbols.  You&rsquo;ll need to select the correct field name again.  With this symbology you should also see a histogram below the symbology dialog which gives information on how many data points are in each class.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Question" src="../images/svg/help_outline-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Correlations</strong></p>
<p>At a quick look, do these ways of symbolising your data show any correlation between lead concentrations and mine locations?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tools-and-analysis">Tools and analysis</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have shown useful information about your data by symbolising it.  Now you can run some tools to generate alternative methods of looking at your data and produce new layers.
<!-- TODO: What am I really trying to say here?  Can I put it more clearly? --></p>
<h3 id="processing-environments">Processing environments</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ll perform interpolation on a section of the data defined by a polygon layer.  Otherwise the 3D Analyst extension in ArcGIS interpolates an area based on the extent of the point layer.  This can be a useful way to keep processing power, time and storage down if you have a lot of data.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Cononish zip file should have included a shapefile called <code>CononishArea.shp</code> - add that to your map now and symbolise it so that the outline is visible, but the polygon has no colour fill.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The symbolised outline of the study area." src="../images/analysis/CononishArea.png" title="The symbolised outline of the study area." /></p>
<p>Tell Arc that you only want to process data for the area within the polygon by going to</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>Analysis</code> tab of the ribbon</li>
<li><code>Environments &gt; Processing Extent &gt; Same as Layer &gt; CononishArea</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also set other useful environments here, such as the spatial reference (coordinate system) for all of your output.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the <code>Output Coordinate System</code> to <code>British National Grid</code> - if your map is in British National Grid you can do this by dropping down the box and choosing <code>Current Map</code>.</li>
<li>Click <code>OK</code> to close the window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Setting the extent and output coordinate system in the Geoprocessing Environments." src="../images/analysis/GeoprocessingEnvironments_small.png" title="Setting the extent and output coordinate system in the Geoprocessing Environments." /></p>
<h3 id="interpolating-a-surface">Interpolating a surface</h3>
<p>The feature class you&rsquo;ve been working with shows the lead concentration at each sample point.  What do you do if you want to know the potential concentration at any other point between these points, or over an area?</p>
<p>Arc gives you tools to <strong>interpolate</strong> point data and calculate z values, or <strong>totals</strong>, for the spaces between the points.</p>
<p>Inevitably the accuracy of the surface will increase if you have more data points in a particular area, but it can still work if your points are widely spaced.</p>
<p>There are different methods of interpolation available in Arc.  The instructions below use Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) as that works well for this geochemical data, but try Spline, Natural Neighbour and Kriging too and have a look at the differences.  Different methods work better for different data.</p>
<p>There is more information in ArcGIS Help - search for <code>Raster Interpolation</code>.</p>
<p>Also see ArcUser for a useful article on <a href="http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0704/files/interpolating.pdf">Interpolating surfaces in ArcGIS Spatial Analyst</a> which is freely available online.</p>

</blockquote>
<h4 id="running-a-geoprocessing-tool">Running a geoprocessing tool</h4>
<p>Now run the tool to carry out the interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the <code>Analysis</code> tab of the ribbon click on the <code>Tools</code> button</li>
<li>Go to the <code>Toolboxes</code> tab then to <code>3D Analyst Tools &gt; Raster &gt; Interpolation &gt; IDW</code></li>
<li>Enter the settings as follows and as in the following image<ul>
<li>The <code>Input point features</code> are your lead concentration layer</li>
<li>The <code>Z value field</code> is the field which holds the concentration values</li>
<li>Give the <code>Output raster</code> a <strong>short</strong> name which means something to you, e.g. IDW_PbConc</li>
<li>Set the <code>Output cell size</code> to <code>5</code></li>
<li>Leave everything else as it is</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then <code>Run</code> the tool</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Filling in the IDW dialog." src="../images/analysis/IDW_small.png" title="Filling in the IDW dialog." /></p>
<p>The output is a <code>raster surface</code>.  Arc should automatically have added it to your map, but you may need to change its location in the Contents so that it is visible, e.g. drag it up above the 1:25 000 raster layer.</p>
<p><img alt="The interpolated layer when it is first added to your map.  The outline is the CononishArea shapefile." src="../images/analysis/IDWoutput_small.png" title="The interpolated layer when it is first added to your map.  The outline is the CononishArea shapefile." /></p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Symbology pane - this is a raster layer so the settings will be a bit different to the vector settings</li>
<li>Arc may have automatically set the symbology to <code>Stretch</code> - if not, select that now</li>
<li>Click on the <code>Color scheme</code> and put a tick in the little box next to <code>Show names</code> then choose <code>Slope</code> or <code>Yellow to Red</code> from the list.  Try some other colour ramps too.</li>
<li>Try playing around with some of the other symbology settings and see what difference they make to the raster layer (also known as a <strong>surface</strong>).  For example, increase the number of <code>classes</code> or try different <code>Stretch types</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The symbology panel for the raster layer.  The type is set to Stretch to show continuous values." src="../images/analysis/StretchedSymbology_small.png" title="The symbology panel for the raster layer.  The type is set to Stretch to show continuous values." /></p>
<p>Repeat the interpolation but this time choose first <code>Spline</code>, then <code>Natural Neighbor</code>, then <code>Kriging</code>.</p>
<p>Have a look at the different results and think about why they are different based on the <a href="http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0704/files/interpolating.pdf">article from ESRI</a>.  In particular note the high and low values for the interpolated surfaces compared to the original data (<a href="#reviewing-the-data">you should have made a note of these values earlier</a>), and the differences in distribution of highs and lows.</p>

<!-- TODO: Some way of saying to the students that the styling of the data is their choice based on their scientific education and experience?  Then some other ways of finding help/suggestions from reading list etc. -->

<h3 id="deriving-contours-from-a-surface">Deriving contours from a surface</h3>
<p>Once you have created a raster surface you can use tools in Arc to derive vector contours to display the surface on a 2D map.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <code>Tools</code> on the <code>Analysis</code> tab of the ribbon then <code>Toolboxes &gt; 3D Analyst Tools &gt; Raster &gt; Surface &gt; Contour</code></li>
<li>Set <code>Input surface</code> to the surface from which you want to derive contours, e.g. the IDW raster or whichever one you chose.</li>
<li>Set <code>Output feature class</code> to the location where you want to save your feature class, e.g. the project geodatabase, and give it a name that means something to you, e.g. IDWcontours (note that it must be short with no spaces)</li>
<li>Set the <code>Contour interval</code> appropriately by looking at the number of units on the surface you are contouring in the contents panel, e.g. for the IDW surface <code>25</code> will probably be suitable as it covers from 12 to 710.</li>
<li>Supply a <code>Base contour</code> if required, that is the lowest contour that will be generated.  Check the lowest value in your data.  It&rsquo;s a good idea to keep the contours as rounded numbers so if your lowest data value is, for example, -12.61 and your contour interval is 25, put in -25 as your base contour.</li>
<li>then <code>Run</code> the tool.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Creating contours with the toolbox." src="../images/analysis/IDWContours.png" title="Creating contours with the toolbox." /></p>
<p>Arc should generate contours and add them as a layer to your map.</p>
<p>Try running the tool again a couple of times, using a different contour interval each time.  Have a look at all of the results and see which gives the best view of your data - e.g. enough contours to show the changes in your data, but not so many that they look crowded.</p>
<p>The contours can be symbolised and labelled in the usual manner - though preferably not in the same colours and styles as the existing topographic contours!</p>
<p><img alt="Contours generated from the IDW surface at 50 unit intervals.  The units in this case are parts per million (ppm)." src="../images/analysis/Contours50.png" title="Contours generated from the IDW surface at 50 unit intervals.  The units in this case are parts per million (ppm)." /></p>
<h3 id="buffering-to-display-distance-from-mines">Buffering to display distance from mines</h3>
<p>One particular use of GIS is to show proximity - that is how close one geographic feature is to another.  Longley (2015), p. 34 (Details are on the <a href="http://lib5.leeds.ac.uk/rlists/broker/?bbModuleId=202021_37122_SOEE1630&amp;bbListId=_8079361_1&amp;s=l">module reading list</a>) quotes Tobler&rsquo;s First Law of Geography:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being able to measure and display the relative proximity of different datasets is a powerful tool.</p>
<p>It is possible to see some of the sites of former mines on the topographic base map.  We&rsquo;ll set up a feature class and digitise these points, then it will be possible to create <strong>buffers</strong> around the points that show the distances from the main mining activity.  Once you&rsquo;ve done this it should be possible to look at your map and see how far from the possible source contamination has travelled.</p>
<p>If you need to remind yourself how to create a feature class and create features within it refer back to <a href="/creating_data/">the chapter on creating data</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new <strong>point</strong> feature class in the project geodatabase and call it <code>Mines</code>.</li>
<li>Add the feature class to your map and edit it to add points at the locations of any mines or related sites that you can find within the outlined area on the map.  There are only a few.  Note that the buildings at Cononish itself are also mine-related.</li>
<li>Remember to <code>Save</code> your edits</li>
<li><code>Clear</code> any selections</li>
<li>Open the geoprocessing panel (Analysis tab of the ribbon and click on Tools)</li>
<li>then use the <code>Find Tools</code> box to find the <code>Multiple Ring Buffer</code> tool<sup id="fnref:503"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:503">4</a></sup>.  When it appears in the list click on it to open the tool.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Finding the Multple Ring Buffer tool in the toolbox." src="../images/analysis/FindingToolbox_small.png" title="Finding the Multple Ring Buffer tool in the toolbox." /></p>
<ul>
<li>Fill in the tool as shown below:<ul>
<li>The <code>Input features</code> are the <strong>Mines</strong> layer</li>
<li>Choose a location to save the <code>Output feature class</code>, preferably the project geodatabase, and give the output a name that makes sense to you, e.g. <code>MinesBuffer</code></li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to add the distances for the width of each ring by typing each one in the <code>Distances</code> box.  Add widths at <code>100 m</code> intervals from <code>100 to 1000</code>.</li>
<li>with <code>Buffer Unit</code> set to <code>default</code> the units should be the same as the map: if your project is in British National Grid this should be metres.  If you want to be sure you can set this in the dialog, though.</li>
<li>Change <code>Dissolve Option</code> to <code>Non-overlapping (rings)</code> so that each buffer is a ring around buffers of a lower value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Run</code> the tool</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Filling in the Multiple Ring Buffer tool." src="../images/analysis/MultipleRingBuffer200_small.png" title="Filling in the Multiple Ring Buffer tool." /></p>
<p>You should end up with a new layer in the Contents and concentric shapes covering your map.</p>
<p>Change the symbology so that each distance buffer is a different colour.  Set the transparency of this layer to something like <code>40%</code>.</p>
<p>Feel free to run the tool again and change the distance and number of rings to settings that you feel are more useful.  Experiment!  You should interpret your data and display as you feel is best.</p>
<p><img alt="The multiple ring buffers on your map overlain by the symbolised lead concentrations point layer." src="../images/analysis/RingBuffersLead2.png" title="The multiple ring buffers on your map overlain by the symbolised lead concentrations point layer." /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Instruction" src="../images/svg/create-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Look at your map</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that your symbolised point layer for lead concentrations is visible and have a look at how the concentrations compare to the distance to the mining area.</p>
<p>How far have the high levels of lead travelled?</p>
<p>Remember that if you used the distances that I suggested, each ring is 200 m further from the mines than the previous one.  You can run the Ring Buffers tool again with a different distance if you think that will be more useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="generating-statistics">Generating statistics</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth looking at how you can extract numbers to help you to show how far the lead contamination has travelled.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Question" src="../images/svg/help_outline-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>What is the average concentration of lead in each buffer?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of tools within ArcGIS and it can be difficult to know where to find the one that you want.  The <a href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/main/arcgis-pro-tool-reference.htm">ArcGIS Pro Help tool reference</a> can help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about what you are trying to do so that you can construct a sensible search - in this case we are trying to find &ldquo;statistics within polygon&rdquo;</li>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/main/arcgis-pro-tool-reference.htm">tool reference</a> and type <code>statistics within polygon</code> into the search box at the top.</li>
<li>The first link should be to a tool called <code>Summarize Within (GeoAnalytics)</code>.  Click on the link to go to the page and have a look at the information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Summary looks very encouraging and the examples are even more so.  This looks worth trying.</p>
<p>If you look further down the Usage section you&rsquo;ll see that there is an option to calculate standard statistics, including <strong>mean</strong>.</p>
<p>In the end, if you try the tool and it doesn&rsquo;t do what you want, you haven&rsquo;t lost anything, and you may even learn something!  So let&rsquo;s have a go.</p>
<ul>
<li>Return to the Cononish project in ArcGIS Pro.</li>
<li>Open the toolbox panel, if it isn&rsquo;t already open, by going to the Analysis tab of the ribbon and clicking on <code>Tools</code></li>
<li>Search for <code>Summarize Within</code> in the toolbox</li>
<li>From the list select <code>Summarize Within (GeoAnalytics Desktop Tools)</code></li>
<li>Fill in the form as follows<ul>
<li>The <code>Summarized Layer</code> is the lead concentration layer</li>
<li>Choose where to save the <code>Output Feature Class</code> and give it a name that will help you to find it again</li>
<li>The <code>Summary Polygons</code> are your Mines Buffers layer</li>
<li>Under <code>Standard Summary Fields</code> choose the <code>concentration</code> field and then choose the type of <code>Statistics</code> that you want to generate, e.g. <code>Mean</code>, <code>Minimum</code> and <code>Maximum</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click on <code>Run</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The Summarize Within tool set up to generate Mean, Minimum and Maximum statistics." src="../images/analysis/SummarizeWithin_small.png" title="The Summarize Within tool set up to generate Mean, Minimum and Maximum statistics." /></p>
<p>The output should be added to your map automatically.  If it isn&rsquo;t, add it from the Catalog.</p>
<p>Make the original buffers layer invisible and have a look at the new layer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Attribute Table and have a look at the fields in the new feature class</li>
<li>Arc has automatically symbolised the layer on the <code>COUNT</code> field, but for our purposes it would be more useful to symbolise on the field containing the <code>MEAN</code> values, so make a note of the name of that field and close the attribute table.</li>
<li>In the Symbology pane set the <code>Field</code> for Graduated Colours to the <code>MEAN</code> field.</li>
<li>Use the settings to display your data in the most informative way</li>
<li>Check that your colours are appropriate for the value bands.
<!-- TODO: The last 2 are rather vague, can I improve this? --></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The Summary layer symbolised by the mean concentration." src="../images/analysis/SummaryRings.png" title="The Summary layer symbolised by the mean concentration." /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Question" src="../images/svg/help_outline-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>What does the summary layer show about your data?</strong></p>
<p>Have a look at it and see how it aids your interpretation of the data.  What conclusions are your audience likely to draw from it?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-final-map">The final map</h2>
<p>You have used the original data to generate a lot of different layers.  You can&rsquo;t just switch all of them on and expect your audience to be able to interpret your map - some of the data probably wouldn&rsquo;t even be visible.  You need to select the layers which help to answer your original question.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-additional-maps">Setting up additional maps</h3>
<p>It is possible to create further maps in your project and move some of the data onto those so that when you set up a layout you can include several maps on one sheet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <code>Insert</code> tab of the ribbon and click on <code>New Map</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A new blank map called something like <code>Map2</code> should appear.  This is the same as your original map with an ESRI base map set.</p>
<ul>
<li>Return to your original map (you should be able to just click on the tab called <code>Map</code> at the top of the map)</li>
<li>Right-click on the <code>Cononish Area</code> polygon and <code>Copy</code></li>
<li>Return to your new map - <code>Map2</code></li>
<li>Right-click on the <code>Map2</code> heading in the Contents pane and select <code>Paste</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The layer you copied should appear in the Contents and on the map.  Arc will zoom to the new layer and with any luck, it will be symbolised in exactly the same way as it was in the first map.</p>
<p>You also need to check the <strong>coordinate system</strong> of the new map (if you need a reminder the instructions are under <a href="/finding_data/#checking-the-coordinate-system-of-your-map">Adding downloaded data to  your map</a>) - it doesn&rsquo;t have to be the same as the original map, but in this case it should be.</p>
<p>In this way you can copy and paste any of your layers between maps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy the 25k raster layer into the new map and remove the ESRI base map layers</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Instruction" src="../images/svg/create-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Setting up multiple maps</strong></p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s really up to you to think about how best to display your data.  Which layers do you need to include?  How many maps can you put on a sheet?</p>
<p>Set up a minimum of three different maps with different layers.  Make sure that any layers that you don&rsquo;t want to display on a particular map are not visible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can rename the maps in the <code>Map Properties</code><sup id="fnref:508"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:508">5</a></sup> if you want to keep track of which is which.</p>
<p>Feel free to use a different background layer from the Ordnance Survey Digimap Download if you think it is more suitable.</p>
<p>If you feel it is relevant you could also <a href="http://localhost:8000/styles/#styling-layers-with-a-layer-file">add a geological map using BGS data downloaded from Digimap</a> in the way you did in the previous chapter.  There is 1:25 000 data available for this area. (The layer files are in a separate folder.  You have to unzip them and move them into the folder with the data files.)  Hint: If you <strong>merge</strong> the similar layers before you apply the layer styles, and if you have the Geoprocessing extent set, you will be dealing with a lot fewer features, which makes it a lot easier to add a key.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-layout-with-multiple-maps">Creating a layout with multiple maps</h3>

<li>Click on the <code>Map Frame</code> button on the <code>Insert</code> tab of the ribbon</li>
<li>Select the thumbnail of the map that you want to include on your layout</li>
<li>Then drag a rectangle onto the page in approximately the area you want it (you can change it later)</li>
<li>Repeat this with any other maps that you want to include</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

<p>Now you can change the scale and the area as you wish.  Move items around on the page until you are happy with them.  Add a <code>Grid</code> and a <code>Scale bar</code>.  Use the text tools to add a title and copyright text.  You should also add a legend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can play with the settings for the elements you have added, but we will be looking at layout and presentation in more detail later.</p>
<p>I suggest that at this stage you set up your layout so that the main map shows the point symbols and mines and maybe includes the outline of the study area.  You can then add a small map showing one of the other data sets, e.g. the mean concentrations in the bands.</p>
<p>The example below shows a possible layout.  Your layout should look different.  You will have made your own decisions about what to include and how to symbolise and label your data.</p>

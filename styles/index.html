<p>The background to styling and labelling data in GIS will be covered in the lecture segment at the beginning of the class, and the presentation and any other supporting materials will be available in Minerva.  The lecture segment should help you to understand <strong>why</strong> you are doing these exercises.  If you still aren&rsquo;t sure, please ask <a href="mailto:c.e.gordon@leeds.ac.uk">Clare</a>.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning outcomes</h2>
<p>When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>explain how to symbolise data on a map so that it displays clearly and informatively to your audience</li>
<li>demonstrate how to add appropriately located labels to the vector features on your map
<!-- TODO: worth revisiting learning outcomes for styles and labelling --></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the previous chapters you have created data and added data from other sources.  Now you&rsquo;ll see how to style, or symbolise, that data and label it appropriately to make a more informative map.</p>
<p>You have symbolised and labelled data in previous chapters, but this chapter brings those techniques together and goes through the options in more detail. It will also introduce some new techniques so that you have a wider range to choose from.  You&rsquo;ll also learn more about styling and labelling geological data when you start to prepare to create a map for your dissertation.</p>
<p>Styling and labelling are subjective processes.  Although there are general &ldquo;rules&rdquo;, sometimes it comes down to what do you think looks best?  Some of the books on the reading list, such as Darkes and Spence (2017) and Brewer (2016), will give you more information about this.</p>
<p>The real thing to remember is to look at your maps and think about your audience.  What are you trying to show them and what is the clearest, most effective way of doing that?</p>
<h2 id="downloading-data">Downloading data</h2>
<!-- You should have kept the final project from the chapter on Finding data and adding it to GIS.  If you haven't, don't worry - just download the file called `FindingData.zip` from Minerva and unzip it to your GIS folder (or the desktop if you are on the Virtual Windows Desktop). -->

<!-- You should have a folder called `FindingData` which contains a file called `FindingData.aprx`.  Open that file in ArcGIS Pro by double-clicking on it and you should see a greyscale map of the Otley Chevin area. -->

<p>The project and data for this section is available to you for download from Minerva</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <code>SOEE1630 &gt; GIS &gt; Week 5</code> and download <code>Styling.zip</code></li>
<li>Unzip this file to your GIS folder</li>
<li>You should have a folder called <code>Styling</code> go in to that folder and open the file called <code>Styling.aprx</code> in ArcGIS Pro</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The initial project for this chapter.  You should be able to see a map of the Otley area with a lightly coloured background and contours. The rest of the data is available for you in the Catalog." src="../images/styles/StylesProject.png" title="The initial project for this chapter.  You should be able to see a map of the Otley area with a lightly coloured background and contours. The rest of the data is available for you in the Catalog." /></p>
<p>The map includes a VectorMap District Raster background map and Terrain 50 contours.  Both layers were downloaded from the Digimap Ordnance Survey collection.  You also have some BGS geological data and some other vector layers available to you in the Catalog.</p>
<ul>
<li>The geology is 1:50 000 BGS data downloaded from Geology Digimap.</li>
<li>The other vector layers are mainly VectorMap District Vector layers from OS Digimap, but the water layers are from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start by symbolising the vector layers to make a background map to replace the raster map, then we&rsquo;ll move on to add the geology data to the map and symbolise that.  Finally we&rsquo;ll create labels for the data to make the map more informative.</p>
<h2 id="styling-your-data">Styling your data</h2>
<p>Start by making the layers that you are about to symbolise visible and turning off the other layers so that you can see what you are doing more clearly</p>
<ul>
<li>The vector layers are all in a <strong>group</strong> in the Contents which is called <code>Vector data</code>.  Click the little box next to that subheading to make all the layers visible.</li>
<li>Untick the little box next to <code>ContoursT50</code> and <code>vmd-raster_3681591.tif</code> to make them invisible - this makes it easier to see what you are doing with the other layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your map should look more like the picture below now.</p>
<p><img alt="The initial view of the &quot;FindingData&quot; project when you have made the vector layers visible and turned off the contour and raster layers.  Note that all of the data is symbolised in random colours, and only one colour per feature class." src="../images/styles/InitialProjectView.png" title="The initial view of the &quot;FindingData&quot; project when you have made the vector layers visible and turned off the contour and raster layers.  Note that all of the data is symbolised in random colours, and only one colour per feature class." /></p>
<p>When you first add a vector feature class to a map, Arc symbolises it with a single, random colour and doesn&rsquo;t add any automatic information about what the features show.  You need to apply styles to your data to differentiate features.</p>
<p>In this section we&rsquo;ll symbolise the data that you&rsquo;ve downloaded so that it becomes an informative, but basic map.</p>
<p>The sections below show the general techniques to change colours, line styles, point symbols etc, but you have to decide for yourself how best to <strong>symbolise</strong> (or style) your data so that your audience can interpret and understand your map.</p>
<p>If you add a key to your map (you&rsquo;ll be shown how to do this in the Layout chapter), it will show the colours and styles that you have set in this section.</p>
<h3 id="styling-polygon-features">Styling polygon features</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start with polygon features as they are often the simplest to style, then we&rsquo;ll move on to lines and points.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the contents pane select the layer that you want to symbolise, in this case we&rsquo;ll start with the <code>WaterArea</code> layer</li>
<li>Go to the <code>Appearance</code> tab of the ribbon and click on <code>Symbology</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The Symbology panel should open on the right and will show the current settings - a single symbol with the colour of the layer as it is now.</p>
<p><img alt="The Symbology pane showing the default single symbol in a random colour." src="../images/styles/DefaultSymbology_small.png" title="The Symbology pane showing the default single symbol in a random colour." /></p>
<h4 id="setting-a-single-symbol-for-a-layer">Setting a single symbol for a layer</h4>
<p>This is the simplest type of symbology and the one that ArcGIS Pro applies to your layers by default.</p>
<p>If you have a layer which contains a single type of feature then you can keep this type and just need to set it to your choice of colour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Video clip" src="../images/svg/videocam-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Symbolising a layer as a single symbol in Arc</strong></p>
<p>This video clip can be found in the module area of <a href="https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk">Minerva</a> or in the <a href="https://cgordon-gis.github.io/videoclips.htm">full list of video clips</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>check that the correct layer is selected at the top of the symbology panel - see the image above - if not click on the correct layer in the contents pane.</li>
<li>the <code>Primary symbology</code> type will already be set to <code>Single Symbol</code></li>
<li>to change the symbol click on the coloured symbol next to <code>Symbol</code></li>
<li>The pane will usually initially show the <code>Gallery</code>.  Try selecting something from here, for example <code>Water (area)</code> - your layer should change to whatever you select.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The Gallery.  Choose a preset style from here to see it applied to your data." src="../images/styles/Gallery_small.png" title="The Gallery.  Choose a preset style from here to see it applied to your data." /></p>
<ul>
<li>To have more control over the symbol click on the <code>Properties</code> tab at the top of the pane</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The Properties dialog.  Here you can build your own styles." src="../images/styles/Properties_small.png" title="The Properties dialog.  Here you can build your own styles." /></p>
<ul>
<li>In the Properties dialog try changing the colour of your feature to a different colour, such as a paler blue, e.g. <code>Sodalite blue</code>, and change the outline colour to a darker shade of the same colour, e.g. <code>Lapis Lazuli</code>, with a narrow width.</li>
<li>This time the colour won&rsquo;t change automatically on your map.  You&rsquo;ll need to click on <code>Apply</code> at the bottom of the pane.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the water area polygons on your map (lakes, ponds, rivers etc) should now be the same colour and outline.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Instruction" src="../images/svg/create-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Symbolising the buildings</strong></p>
<p>The <code>building</code> layer also needs to be symbolised as a single colour.  Try that now for yourself.  There is a style called <code>Building Footprint</code> in the Gallery that you could use, or set your own style.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve symbolised your water areas and buildings your map should look something like the image below.</p>
<p><img alt="The vector data with the water areas and buildings styled." src="../images/styles/InterimView1_small.png" title="The vector data with the water areas and buildings styled." /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Warning" src="../images/svg/warning-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Save your map</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to save your map at regular intervals.  Arc can crash and you don&rsquo;t want to loose the work you&rsquo;ve already done.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="setting-unique-values-for-a-layer">Setting unique values for a layer</h4>
<p>Setting unique values for a layer allows you to categorise your data.  For example, if you have a single layer for <code>NaturalFeature</code> and within that you have multiple types of feature, such as &lsquo;water&rsquo;, &lsquo;heath&rsquo;, &lsquo;wood&rsquo;, you can set each type as a category and then symbolise each with a different colour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Video clip" src="../images/svg/videocam-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Symbolising a layer by unique values in Arc</strong></p>
<p>This video clip can be found in the module area of <a href="https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk">Minerva</a> or in the <a href="https://cgordon-gis.github.io/videoclips.htm">full list of video clips</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already checked the contents of your data then it&rsquo;s a good idea to do that now so that you know which field you need to use to symbolise it on.</p>
<ul>
<li>go to the attribute table of the <code>NaturalFeature</code> layer (right-click on it in the Contents and select <code>Attribute table</code>)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Question" src="../images/svg/help_outline-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Which field will you symbolise on?</strong></p>
<p>Have a look at the data in the table.  One of the fields (columns) will contain data about the type of natural feature.  You may have to look through quite a few columns to find it.</p>
<p>Which field is that?  Make a note of the column heading then close the attribute table.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Check that the correct layer is selected and if the symbology pane isn&rsquo;t already open, open it now</li>
<li>To change the Primary Symbology, drop down the box at the top of the pane and change it to <code>Unique Values</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The symbology pane showing Unique Values - note the choice of field to categorise the data." src="../images/styles/UniqueValues_small.png" title="The symbology pane showing Unique Values - note the choice of field to categorise the data." /></p>
<ul>
<li>By default Arc will usually use the first field in your feature class to categorise the data, which is unlikely to be the right one, so change <code>Field 1</code> to the field you decided above you should use for the unique values - I would suggest <code>natural</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arc should automatically set a colour scheme and give a colour to each category.  In the case of the layer I&rsquo;ve given you there are 10 values.</p>
<p>To change the colours and symbols:</p>
<ul>
<li>To change the colour scheme for all the colours at once, use the <code>Color Scheme</code> dropdown and pick another - clicking on <code>Format color scheme</code> takes you to the Color Scheme Editor if you&rsquo;re not happy with the choices.</li>
</ul>
<p>To have more control over your symbols you can change them individually</p>
<ul>
<li>click on the colour patch for the <code>wood</code> category in the list of classes.</li>
<li>You should go to a familiar dialog - either the Gallery or the Properties.</li>
<li>Go to the <code>Properties</code> now and set the <code>Color</code> to <code>Spruce Green</code>.  If you hover over the colours in the selectors you are shown a tool tip with the name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you click on <code>Apply</code> your layer should change to your choice of colour.</p>
<p>Note that I&rsquo;ve chosen green for the woods because in general that&rsquo;s the colour your audience would expect them to be.</p>
<p>Feel free to carry on and symbolise any of the other categories in a suitable colour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Information" src="../images/svg/info-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Choosing colours for polygons</strong></p>
<p>There is a lot of advice in the books on the <a href="http://lib5.leeds.ac.uk/rlists/broker/?bbModuleId=202021_37122_SOEE1630&amp;bbListId=_8079361_1&amp;s=l">reading list</a> about choosing colours for maps.</p>
<p>In addition try the <a href="https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&amp;scheme=BuGn&amp;n=3">Color Brewer web site</a> - it lets you play with colour combinations and is specifically aimed at people making maps.</p>
<p>Note that if you are going to be making a layer transparent then you will probably find that it is best to choose strong colours, such as <code>Steel Blue</code>, for your polygons.  They will fade when you apply transparency.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="removing-feature-categories-that-are-not-required">Removing feature categories that are not required</h5>
<p>There are a lot of other feature types available.  If you don&rsquo;t need these for your map it is possible to remove them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the control key to click on multiple feature categories - in this case click on <code>water, shingle</code> (water is already symbolised on your map as a separate layer).</li>
<li>then right-click and select <code>Remove</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those feature types will be removed from the list and from the key in the Contents pane.</p>
<p>You will notice that they aren&rsquo;t actually removed from your map, though.  Instead of an individual colour any feature which doesn&rsquo;t belong to a category in your symbology will be coloured with the symbol that appears next to <code>&lt;all other values&gt;</code> in the Contents.</p>
<h5 id="removing-the-all-other-values-heading">Removing  the All other values heading</h5>
<p>If you have feature categories that aren&rsquo;t individually symbolised but show as <code>&lt;all other values&gt;</code>, or if you just want to tidy up your key by removing the All other values heading, do the following</p>
<ul>
<li>In the classes pane of the Symbology pane click on <code>More</code> above the table</li>
<li>Deselect <code>Show all other values</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="controlling-transparency-with-the-color-editor">Controlling transparency with the Color Editor</h4>
<p>There are a lot of settings that you can use and you should investigate them for yourself, but one of the most useful is the <code>Color Editor</code>.</p>
<p>If you set <a href="/introduction/#make-layers-transparent">transparency for a layer</a>, as you&rsquo;ve been shown previously, then everything in that layer is transparent - the outlines as well as the fill.  Using the Color Editor you can make just the fill transparent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click to edit the symbol for the <code>wood</code> category</li>
<li>Click on the patch next to <code>Color</code> as if you were going to change the colour again</li>
<li>then click on <code>Color properties</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You should find that the <code>Color Editor</code> opens.</p>
<p><img alt="The Color Editor - complete control over the choice of colours for your features." src="../images/styles/ColorEditor_small.png" title="The Color Editor - complete control over the choice of colours for your features." /></p>
<ul>
<li>There you can alter the <code>Transparency</code> using the lowest of the four colour bars (assuming <code>Color Model</code> is set to <code>RGB</code>), e.g. set it to <code>40%</code> and see what difference that makes when you click <code>OK &gt; Apply</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is no layer behind this one you may not see much difference, but if there is you should be able to see it now - depending on the order of your layers in the contents you should find that features covered up by the wood polygon now become visible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Instruction" src="../images/svg/create-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Change the colour of some other natural feature polygons</strong></p>
<p>Use the instructions above to colour the following categories, using your own choice of colours and setting transparency for the fills</p>
<p><code>wetland</code> - try looking for the <code>Swamp</code> style in the gallery</p>
<p><code>heath</code> - probably a shade of purple for heather</p>
<p><code>scrub</code> - maybe pale green</p>
<p>Feel free to <strong>remove</strong> the other categories - there are hardly any features which match those on this particular map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember to save your project at regular intervals.</p>
<h3 id="styling-line-features">Styling line features</h3>
<p>Symbolising or styling line features is basically the same as <a href="#styling-polygon-features">symbolising polygon features</a> so refer back to the instructions for those too, but there are some extra things to think about in addition to choosing colours for fill and outline.</p>
<h4 id="as-a-single-symbol">As a single symbol</h4>
<p>This is very similar to styling polygons</p>
<ul>
<li>select the <code>Waterway</code> layer and go to the symbology panel</li>
<li>Leaving the Primary Symbology as <code>Single Symbol</code> click on the line symbol next to <code>Symbol</code></li>
<li>From the Gallery select <code>Water (line)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You should now have pale blue lines on your map indicating streams and other water courses.</p>
<p><img alt="The map showing all of the layers that you've symbolised so far, including the Waterways." src="../images/styles/InterimView2_small.png" title="The map showing all of the layers that you've symbolised so far, including the Waterways." /></p>
<h4 id="symbolising-dashed-lines">Symbolising dashed lines</h4>
<p>You may well need to set dashed lines on a map, for example if you are creating a geological map you may need to add inferred boundaries.  The data you are using here is for a railway and in this case we&rsquo;ll symbolise it as a dashed line.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <code>SE_RailwayTrack</code> layer and <code>Zoom to Layer</code> - there are only a couple in this area.</li>
<li>Turn off all of the other layers so that you can see what you are doing with this layer</li>
<li>It can be easier to see what you are doing if you <a href="/finding_data/#setting-the-reference-scale">set a reference scale</a>, in this case probably to 1:50 000, and then zoom in.</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest way to add a dashed line is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the symbology pane and check the <code>SE_RailwayTrack</code> layer is selected </li>
<li>Click on the line symbol next to <code>Symbol</code></li>
<li>Go to the <strong>Gallery</strong> and scroll down to look for <code>Dashed 4:4</code> and click on it<sup id="fnref:401"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:401">1</a></sup></li>
<li>Railways will usually be symbolised as a black line, so if the colour isn&rsquo;t black change it to that in the Properties now </li>
<li>Using the gallery will also have changed the line width to <code>0.4 pt</code>.  You can chose your own line width but for now change this to <code>1 pt</code> so that it is more visible.</li>
<li>Click <code>Apply</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Using the gallery to change a line to dashes." src="../images/styles/DashedLinesGallery.png" title="Using the gallery to change a line to dashes." /></p>
<p>You can also set up the dashes manually.  This also allows you to edit the style that you&rsquo;ve set from the gallery if it doesn&rsquo;t do quite what you want it to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the line symbol for the railway again</li>
<li>In the <code>Format symbol</code> dialog go to the <code>Properties</code> tab</li>
<li>click on the <code>Layers</code> button - you&rsquo;ll probably need to use the tooltips to find this</li>
<li>select a colour as <code>Black</code> under <code>Appearance</code> if you need to</li>
<li>drop down <code>Dash effect</code> to see the options, and select a <code>Dash type</code> from the drop down list.</li>
<li>Now you can change the numbers in the <code>Dash template</code> to alter the spaces and dashes for your lines - the first number applies to the length of the dash, the second to the spaces - try setting it to <code>2 10</code> and use the <code>tab</code> key to move out of the box to see what it looks like.  Then change it to <code>6 6</code> to see the difference</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Setting the properties for a dashed line manually." src="../images/styles/DashedLinesManual_small.png" title="Setting the properties for a dashed line manually." /></p>
<ul>
<li>When you are happy with the line click on <code>Apply</code>.  There are only a couple of these on the map so you might not see much difference.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="symbolising-lines-with-decoration">Symbolising lines with &ldquo;decoration&rdquo;</h4>
<p>Some lines need extra symbols to show more information.  Decorations on lines can include but are not limited to</p>
<ul>
<li>the &ldquo;ticks&rdquo; to show downthrow on faults</li>
<li>little triangles or &ldquo;barbs&rdquo; which show thrust faults</li>
<li>crosses or arrows to show fold axes</li>
</ul>
<p>For this example we&rsquo;ll symbolise the <code>SE_RailwayTrack</code> layer with ticks.</p>
<p>The simplest way to apply symbols on lines is to check for existing line styles in the gallery.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you check the Gallery there is a symbol for <code>Railroad</code> - set your railways to that now.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t find what you want try <a href="#finding-and-using-additional-arcgis-pro-styles">downloading extra styles
 from ESRI</a> and see if that helps.  You&rsquo;ll see how to do this in a later section.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t find the symbol you need then you&rsquo;ll need to set it up for yourself.  We&rsquo;ll go through this for the railways now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the line symbol next to <code>Symbol</code> in the Primary symbology pane for the <code>SE_RailwayTrack</code> layer</li>
<li>Start by setting the railways back to a single black line with no dashes using the Gallery.</li>
<li>Open the <code>Format line symbol</code> pane and go to the <code>Properties</code></li>
<li>Click on the spanner symbol - if you hover over it you&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s <code>Structure</code></li>
<li>Click to <code>Add symbol layer &gt; Marker layer</code> - this adds a symbol on top of your line</li>
<li>To change the symbol click on the <code>Layers</code> button at the top (use tooltips!) and check that the <code>Shape marker</code> is selected at the top.</li>
<li>For this example click on the small button next to Form which has 3 coloured shapes on it then select the vertical line - as shown in the picture below.  You could also select a symbol from Style or Font instead.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Click on the button with coloured shapes, then select the vertical line." src="../images/styles/SelectingShape_small.png" title="Click on the button with coloured shapes, then select the vertical line." /></p>
<p>Now you can experiment with the settings until the line looks as you require in the window below.</p>
<ul>
<li>make the vertical line width so that it looks the same as the main line - e.g. <code>1 pt</code> and a bit shorter, e.g. <code>6 pt</code></li>
<li>try changing the <code>Marker Placement &gt; Perpendicular offset</code> until the vertical line sits on top of the horizontal line - though for a railway line it will look better if it is centred so move it back again!</li>
<li>Change the colour of both the vertical line and the main line to the same dark grey, e.g. <code>Grey 80%</code></li>
<li>To change the spacing of the vertical lines on the line<ul>
<li>drop down the <code>Marker placement</code> subheading</li>
<li>change the <code>Placement template</code> number, e.g. make it <code>5</code> to make the symbols closer (this may look a bit odd and uneven as the railway layer has been digitised as lots of very short features, rather than one long line)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once you are happy with your symbol click <code>Apply</code> and have a look at it on the main map.  You may want to make more changes before you are happy with it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The symbolised railway line showing the line decorations." src="../images/styles/RailwaySymbol.png" title="The symbolised railway line showing the line decorations." /></p>
<h4 id="setting-unique-values-for-a-layer_1">Setting unique values for a layer</h4>
<p>Again, this is very similar to symbolising polygons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn on and select the <code>SE_Road</code> layer in the contents and have a look at the attribute table.</li>
<li>Note the field called <code>CLASSIFICA</code> - for Classification.  This contains information on the <strong>type</strong> of road and this is the field we&rsquo;ll use to create the Unique values.</li>
<li>Go to the Symbology pane for the road layer and select <code>Unique Values</code></li>
<li>Set <code>Field 1</code> to the <code>CLASSIFICA</code> field - you should end up with about 11 values.</li>
<li>Select the line symbol next to <code>A Road</code> and go to the Gallery</li>
<li>From the Gallery select the symbol for <code>Major Road</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that these symbols are the symbols usually used on maps in the USA, rather than the OS maps that we&rsquo;re more used to in Britain.  When you apply this to your map you&rsquo;ll also notice that there are a lot of lines across the roads - we can get rid of those.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <code>Properties</code> tab of the Symbology pane</li>
<li>Then go to the <code>Layers</code> tab - remember you can use tooltips to find it</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this apparently single line is actually made up of two lines, the lower being thicker than the upper so that it looks as if it is the outline.  This is how you can outline an outline!</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the top layer - the paler <code>Solid stroke</code><ul>
<li>Under appearance change the colour of that to <code>Pointsettia Red</code></li>
<li>and under <code>Caps &amp;amp; Join</code> change the <code>Cap type</code> to <code>Butt</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now select the other layer, which is also a <code>Solid stroke</code><ul>
<li>Change the colour of that to <code>Gray 60%</code></li>
<li>Change the Cap type to <code>Butt</code></li>
<li>and change the <code>Width</code> to <code>3.2</code> to make the outline appear a bit thinner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click on <code>Apply</code> to see the effect on your map</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The symbolised A roads." src="../images/styles/RoadSymbols.png" title="The symbolised A roads." /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Instruction" src="../images/svg/create-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Symbolising roads</strong></p>
<p>Use the instructions above to also symbolise the following categories</p>
<p><code>Primary Road</code> - try the symbol for <code>Highway</code> as it&rsquo;s wider than A roads</p>
<p><code>B Road</code> - these are usually orange</p>
<p><code>Minor Road</code> - try yellow for these</p>
<p><code>Local Street</code> - make these grey outlines around white roads</p>
<p>Feel free to symbolise the other categories too, or just remove them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you have symbolised these lines turn the other layers that you&rsquo;ve already symbolised back on on your map and save the project.</p>
<p>Set the map to 1:50 000 scale then you should reset the <a href="/finding_data/#setting-the-reference-scale">reference scale</a> to 1:50 000 if it isn&rsquo;t already as this is the scale of the data that you are using.</p>
<p><img alt="Your map should be starting to look something like this by now." src="../images/styles/InterimView3.png" title="Your map should be starting to look something like this by now." /></p>
<h3 id="styling-point-features">Styling point features</h3>
<p>Again, basic point styling is very similar to styling lines and polygons.</p>
<p>In the project you downloaded look in the Contents under the <code>Vector data</code> group.  You should be able to find a feature class called <code>Postcodes</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <code>Postcodes</code> layer isn&rsquo;t already visible, tick in the box next to it so that it appears on your map.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="styling-point-features-as-a-single-symbol">Styling point features as a single symbol</h4>
<p>As usual, Arc will have given the layer default symbology when it was added to the map.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <code>Postcodes</code> layer in the contents and open the Symbology panel</li>
<li>Click on the point symbol and from the Gallery select <code>Tear Pin 1 (40%)</code> - you may need to search or go down the list quite a way to find this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The Postcodes point layer symbolised as a single symbol." src="../images/styles/SinglePointSymbols.png" title="The Postcodes point layer symbolised as a single symbol." /></p>
<h4 id="styling-points-as-unique-values">Styling points as Unique Values</h4>
<p>For this part, turn on the <code>SE_FunctionalSite</code> layer in the Contents</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a look at the attribute table and make a note of the column that contains the classification</li>
<li>Use <code>Unique Values</code> for the symbology and set it so that each type of place has a different colour symbol.  <a href="#removing-the-all-other-values-heading">Stop All other values from showing</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your &ldquo;functional sites&rdquo; will be symbolised as a series of spots of different colours.</p>
<p><img alt="The Functional Sites layer symbolised as the initial random coloured unique values." src="../images/styles/PlacesUniqueValues.png" title="The Functional Sites layer symbolised as the initial random coloured unique values." /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Instruction" src="../images/svg/create-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Styling point features</strong></p>
<p>In the same way that you symbolised the polygons and lines click on the points next to the entries in the <code>Classes</code> list and try out the options both from the Gallery and the Properties.  There are no detailed instructions here because it is so similar to previous sections.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- #### Other ways of styling point layers -->

<!--  -->

<!-- In addition to Single symbol and Unique values there are other choices for ways to style point layers. -->

<!--  -->

<!-- * Return to the `Postcodes` layer and have a look at the attribute table. -->

<!--  -->

<!-- You should see that there is a field called `Total_number_of_delivery_points`.  We'll use this to try out different ways of displaying the data. -->

<!--  -->

<!-- ##### Graduated colours -->

<!--  -->

<!-- * Turn off all of the other layers in the Contents so that you can see what is happening to this layer. -->

<!-- * In the symbology panel change the `Primary symbology` to `Graduated Colors` -->

<!-- * Change the `Field` to `Total_number_of_delivery_points` -->

<!-- * Change the `Method` to `Defined Interval` -->

<!-- * Change `Interval size` to read `20` -->

<!--  -->

<!-- Your map should show a lot of dots coloured in 5 classes depending on how many delivery points there are in the postcode area for which that dot indicates the centre. -->

<!--  -->

<!-- ![The Postcode layer symbolised by the Graduated Colors method.](images/styles/GraduatedColor.png "The Postcode layer symbolised by the Graduated Colors method.") -->

<!--  -->

<!-- > ![Instruction](images/svg/create-black-24dp.png) __Graduated Colors__ -->

<!--  -->

<!-- > Try out some of the other choices in the Graduated Colors settings. -->

<!--  -->

<!-- ##### Graduated symbols -->

<!--  -->

<!-- * In the symbology panel change the `Primary symbology` to `Graduated Symbols` -->

<!-- * Change the `Field` to `Total_number_of_delivery_points` -->

<!-- * Change the `Method` to `Defined Interval` -->

<!-- * Change `Interval size` to read `20` -->

<!--  -->

<!-- Once again your map should show a lot of dots, but this time the size gives an indication of how many delivery points there are in the postcode area. -->

<!--  -->

<!-- ![The Postcode layer symbolised by the Graduated Symbols method.](images/styles/GraduatedSymbols.png "The Postcode layer symbolised by the Graduated Symbols method.") -->

<!--  -->

<!-- Again you can try out the choices available and see what difference it makes to your map. -->

<!--  -->

<!-- ##### Proportional symbols -->

<!--  -->

<!-- * In the symbology panel change the `Primary symbology` to `Proportional Symbols` -->

<!-- * Change the `Field` to `Total_number_of_delivery_points` -->

<!--  -->

<!-- This time the dots should vary continuously in size from the points with a value of 1 to those with the top value. -->

<!--  -->

<!-- ![The Postcode layer symbolised by the Proportional Symbols method.](images/styles/ProportionalSymbols.png "The Postcode layer symbolised by the Proportional Symbols method.") -->

<!--  -->

<!-- Again you can try out the choices available and see what difference it makes to your map.  This time you also have a histogram which shows the spread of your data. -->

<!--  -->

<!-- These options are all possibilities for displaying your data and in each case you'll need to decide for yourself which one is best based on your statistical knowledge and knowledge of your data. -->

<!--  -->

<!-- We won't need this layer again so -->

<!--  -->

<!-- * either `Remove` the `Postcodes` layer completely from your Contents, or untick so that it doesn't show. -->

<!-- * Ensure that the other layers that you've symbolised are all visible. -->

<h3 id="finding-and-using-additional-arcgis-pro-styles">Finding and using additional ArcGIS Pro styles</h3>
<p>There are only a relatively limited range of symbols available in ArcGIS Pro when you first install it and sometimes you&rsquo;ll need more.</p>
<p>ESRI provide <a href="https://esri-styles.maps.arcgis.com/home/gallery.html">further styles via a gallery</a>.  Unfortunately it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be possible to preview the symbols, but there are symbol sets such as <code>Ordnance Survey</code> and <code>Geology 24k</code> which should be helpful.</p>
<p>To install more symbols in your project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the <code>Public_Signs_en.stylx</code> style from the <a href="https://esri-styles.maps.arcgis.com/home/gallery.html">Gallery</a> by clicking on it in the list (it&rsquo;s quite a long way down) to go to the individual page, then clicking on the <code>Download</code> button.  You should end up with a <code>.stylx</code> file</li>
<li>Move or copy the stylx file into your map project folder, e.g. <code>Styling</code></li>
<li>Go to the <code>Insert</code> tab of the ribbon</li>
<li>Click on <code>Add</code> in the <code>Styles</code> group and select to <code>Add Style</code></li>
<li>Navigate to where you saved the <code>.stylx</code> file and select it.  You may get a message about the style not being the correct version, if you do click to allow it to update</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done this you won&rsquo;t get any messages to say it&rsquo;s done, but you should find that you have a lot more styles available to you in the Gallery.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the symbology panel for the <code>SE_FunctionalSite</code> layer</li>
<li>click on the point symbol next to <code>Air Transport</code></li>
<li>Go to the Gallery and scroll down to look for the section of <code>Public_Signs_en</code> styles</li>
<li>Under that look for <code>Air Transportation</code> and click on one of the symbols that comes up.  You can also use the search box at the top to search for <code>Air</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The end result should be a square symbol showing an airplane on a blue background.</p>
<p><img alt="The Air Transport symbols from the Public Signs symbol set - choose one of these." src="../images/styles/AirTransportSymbol.png" title="The Air Transport symbols from the Public Signs symbol set - choose one of these." /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Instruction" src="../images/svg/create-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Functional site symbols</strong></p>
<p>You can continue to symbolise the rest of the Functional Site symbols by searching for the appropriate symbol from either the Public Signs symbol set or the ArcGIS 2D set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to <strong>save your work</strong> from time to time.</p>
<p>To finish the map</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn the <code>ContoursT50</code> layer back on to provide height data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your map should now look something like the picture below.</p>
<p><img alt="The map with layers symbolised and contours turned back on." src="../images/styles/InterimView4_small.png" title="The map with layers symbolised and contours turned back on." /></p>
<h3 id="styling-layers-with-a-layer-file">Styling layers with a layer file</h3>
<p>In this section we&rsquo;ll add geological data from the BGS to our maps and symbolise it using BGS styles.</p>
<p>Have a look in the Catalog for the <code>Styling</code> project.  You should find a folder called <code>bgs-50k</code>.  This contains BGS geological data downloaded from Digimap.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the <code>bgs-50k</code> folder in the Catalog and then in to the <code>ew069</code> folder.</li>
<li>Add the following layers to your map - make sure you add the <code>.shp</code> files and that you add them to the top of the Contents list.<ul>
<li><code>ew069_bradford_bedrock.shp</code></li>
<li><code>ew069_bradford_linear.shp</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These layers will cover up your existing map and will be given a single, random colour. </p>
<p><img alt="The bedrock and linear geology layers with random styles." src="../images/styles/GeologyAdded.png" title="The bedrock and linear geology layers with random styles." /></p>
<p>When you added the geology layers to your project you may have noticed that in addition to the shapefiles (.shp) there were also files that ended with the extension <code>.lyr</code> but had the same names as the shapefiles.</p>
<p>These are <code>Layer files</code> and can be used to style the data layers which are in the shapefiles.</p>
<p>There are two possible ways to use layer files to symbolise the shapefiles and it is your choice which one you use.  Both will give the same final result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Video clip" src="../images/svg/videocam-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Symbolising a layer with a layer file (.lyr)</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<h4 id="add-the-data-layer-first">Add the data layer first</h4>
<p>You already have the data layers in your map so we&rsquo;ll start with this method.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <code>ew069_bradford_bedrock</code> layer in the Contents</li>
<li>then click on the <code>Symbology</code> button on the <code>Appearance</code> tab of the ribbon</li>
<li>Click on the menu icon (three horizontal lines) at the top right of the Symbology panel and select <code>Import symbology...</code> to open the geoprocessing tool</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The geoprocessing tool to Apply Symbology From Layer." src="../images/styles/ApplySymbologyFromLayer_small.png" title="The geoprocessing tool to Apply Symbology From Layer." /></p>
<ul>
<li>Your current layer should already be entered under <code>Input Layer</code></li>
<li>Click on the folder button next to the <code>Symbology Layer</code> drop down and navigate to the location of the layer files.  There should be a layer file that matches your shapefile - <code>ew069_bradford_bedrock.lyr</code></li>
<li>Click on the layer file, then <code>OK</code></li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a good idea to set <code>Update Symbology Ranges by Data</code> to <code>Update Ranges</code> so that only the symbology you actually need is used.  This will make creating a legend much simpler!</li>
<li>Then <code>Run</code> the tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data should now be symbolised according to BGS categories as shown below.</p>
<p>Repeat the steps above to symbolise the linear geology layer.</p>
<p><img alt="The BGS linear and bedrock layers styled with the layer file." src="../images/styles/BGSGeologyStyled.png" title="The BGS linear and bedrock layers styled with the layer file." /></p>
<h4 id="add-the-layer-file-first">Add the layer file first</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you already have the bedrock and linear layers in your project turn them off in the contents pane</li>
<li>Go into the Catalog and this time instead of adding the .shp files to your map add the <code>.lyr</code> files</li>
</ul>
<p>If it works immediately and you can see a fully symbolised geological map then that&rsquo;s a bonus and you don&rsquo;t need to repair the data source.</p>
<p>If, however, you get the dreaded red exclamation marks next to your layers in the contents and nothing new on the map then you need to tell the layer file where to find the data on <strong>your</strong> computer.  It doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ve done anything wrong, you just need to know how to solve it by <a href="/creating_data/#repairing-broken-file-links">repairing the broken file links</a> as shown in the previous chapter.</p>
<p><img alt="The red exclamation marks showing that Arc can't find the data source for the layer." src="../images/styles/MissingDataSource.png" title="The red exclamation marks showing that Arc can't find the data source for the layer." /></p>
<h4 id="making-the-layer-transparent">Making the layer transparent</h4>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve applied the layer file to your shapefile you can see the geology, but it isn&rsquo;t transparent so you can&rsquo;t see the base map through it.  Your audience need to be able to identify <strong>where</strong> the geology is.</p>
<p>To allow the base map to show through you need to make the bedrock layer <a href="/introduction/#make-layers-transparent">transparent, following the instructions you were given in the first chapter</a>.</p>
<p>You may find that your map looks better if you turn off the <code>Vector data</code> group which contains the layers you styled in the previous sections, and instead turn on the <code>vmd-raster_3681591.tif</code> background layer.</p>
<p>Your final map should look something like the map below when you zoom in.</p>
<p><img alt="The final map with transparency applied to the geology layers so that the background map shows through." src="../images/styles/BGSGeologyTransparent.png" title="The final map with transparency applied to the geology layers so that the background map shows through." /></p>
<p>Save this map - you&rsquo;ll be using it again in the section below on labelling your data.</p>
<h2 id="labelling-your-data">Labelling your data</h2>
<p>If you look at any map you&rsquo;ll be able to see that attributes from the attribute table have been used to add <strong>labels</strong>.  Labels on your data are essential to the understanding of the map.</p>
<p>When you have information in your attribute tables it is really easy to add labels to your features.  You may not need to add them to all layers, but they can really help interpretation.  For example, if you look at <a href="https://www.bgs.ac.uk/information-hub/bgs-maps-portal/">British Geological Survey maps</a> they add symbols or letters to each rock polygon which are then included in the key and make it easier to spot which symbol is which.  Points can be labelled to show location names, or dip angle and names can be added to lines, such as &ldquo;Moine Thrust&rdquo; on the appropriate thrust fault.</p>
<h3 id="adding-simple-labels">Adding simple labels</h3>
<p>You should have a bedrock geology layer in your <code>FindingData</code> map which you symbolised with the BGS layer styles.  You&rsquo;ll use that to try out labelling polygons by adding a code for each rock formation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Select the <code>ew069_bradford_bedrock</code> layer in the Contents</li>
<li>Start by looking at the attribute table.  You need a short abbreviation with which to label each bedrock polygon on your map.  Which attribute contains a short abbreviation for the rock formation name?</li>
<li>With the correct layer selected click on the <code>Labeling</code> tab of the ribbon</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The Labeling tab of the ribbon showing the tools available." src="../images/styles/LabellingTab.png" title="The Labeling tab of the ribbon showing the tools available." /></p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <code>Label</code> button on the far left of the ribbon</li>
</ul>
<p>Arc will add labels to your map but they will be from the first field in your feature class, which is unlikely to be the correct one and could be a load of apparently random numbers!</p>
<p>To select the correct field:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the dropdown next to <code>Field</code> on the left of the ribbon to select the field that contains the labels you wish to use - in this case I suggest you use the <code>LEX</code> field.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should find that the labels from the field you&rsquo;ve chosen appear on your map - be patient it can take Arc a while to draw them.</p>
<p><img alt="Labels from the LEX field on the Bedrock polygons on the map." src="../images/styles/GeologyLabels.png" title="Labels from the LEX field on the Bedrock polygons on the map." /></p>
<p>Once you have the basic labels you can use the other tools on the Labeling ribbon to change the font, size, colour or placement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Instruction" src="../images/svg/create-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Changing label properties</strong></p>
<p>Try changing the font of your labels and making them smaller or larger.  Change the colour to a dark grey instead of black.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can try out various fonts for your labels, but note that the final one you choose should be something which is clear for your audience to read.  Also note that while your labels should be big enough to be read, they don&rsquo;t need to be large unless they are <strong>really</strong> important.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can use the <strong>Label Class panel</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>on the Labelling ribbon click on the small downwards arrow at the lower right of either the Text Symbol or the Label Placement group.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The Label Class panel.  Drop down the subheadings to find lots of options for placing and formatting your labels." src="../images/styles/LabelClassPanel.png" title="The Label Class panel.  Drop down the subheadings to find lots of options for placing and formatting your labels." /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Instruction" src="../images/svg/create-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Label options</strong></p>
<p>Try out some of the options on the <code>Symbol</code> and <code>Position</code> tabs to see what they do.</p>
<p>Try adding a Halo or Shadow to your labels.  Does it make them clearer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually best to keep label styles simple - you&rsquo;re aiming for readability not fancy - but a narrow <strong>halo</strong> or a <strong>callout</strong> can be useful techniques for making labels clearer if used in moderation.</p>
<h4 id="label-placement">Label placement</h4>
<!-- TODO: Do I really need to include so much on label placement? -->

<p>The most complex part of labelling is ensuring that the labels are in the best place with regard to the feature they apply to, without getting in the way of other labels.</p>
<h5 id="placing-labels-for-points">Placing labels for points</h5>
<p>The placement of labels for polygons can be relatively straightforward, though it&rsquo;s a good idea to experiment, but placing points can be more complex.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you have the <code>SE_NamedPlace</code> layer on your map and that it is visible.  If you&rsquo;ve turned of the vector layers you&rsquo;ll need to drag and drop it out of the <code>Vector data</code> layer so that you can see it.</li>
<li>Make the other layers invisible</li>
<li>Turn labels on for the Place layer by clicking the <code>Label</code> button on the far left of the Labeling ribbon and select <code>DISTNAME</code> in the field dropdown as the label content.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The default locations for the names from the Places feature class." src="../images/styles/LabellingPoints.png" title="The default locations for the names from the Places feature class." /></p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll probably need to start by making the font smaller, e.g. <code>6</code>, as there are a lot of names on this map</li>
<li>Look at the <code>Position</code> tab and the <code>Placement</code> options in the Label Class dialog</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The position tab for positioning labels on point features." src="../images/styles/LabelPosition.png" title="The position tab for positioning labels on point features." /></p>
<p>The dialog is automatically set to <code>Best position</code> - you can see above that most of the labels are placed at top right, but if they are likely to overlap other labels then they are moved according to the preference in the zones shown on the dialog.</p>
<p>The simplest way to change placement is to use the drop down at the top of the dialog.  Change that now to one of the other settings, e.g. <code>Top of point</code>.  You should see all of your labels jump to that location.</p>
<p>Sometimes the point marks where the label should actually occur.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the Placement to <code>Centered on point</code></li>
<li>This will look odd because you can still see the point, but it&rsquo;s underneath the labels.</li>
<li>to prevent that you need to symbolise the points so that the fill and outline have <code>No color</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These are all settings that you can play with to make your map as clear as possible.</p>
<h5 id="placing-labels-for-lines">Placing labels for lines</h5>
<p>Labelling lines creates another set of challenges.  Do you need your labels above the line, or on top of it?  Does it need to follow the line exactly or can it be straight?</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off the <code>SE_NamedPlace</code> layer and turn on <code>SE_Road</code></li>
<li>Have a look at the attribute table for the <code>SE_Road</code> layer.  You should be able to see that the <code>DISTNAME</code> column contains street names.</li>
<li>Zoom in to about 1:20 000 on an area of the map which has quite a lot of roads, so that the roads look quite wide.</li>
<li>Now go to the Labeling tab of the ribbon and select to label the road layer with the <code>DISTNAME</code> field.</li>
<li>Set the font size to <code>3</code> by typing in the box</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think about the road maps you are used to, the name of the street is usually <strong>on top of</strong> the street it applies to, so we&rsquo;ll set that now.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <code>Label Placement</code> group of the ribbon scroll down the selection box until you find <code>European Streets</code> and click on that</li>
</ul>
<p>You may need to wait a short while for your labels to move but they should now appear within the lines of the road symbol and should be curved to follow the roads where appropriate.</p>
<p><img alt="Street names set using the European Road Placement." src="../images/styles/LabelsRoadPlacement.png" title="Street names set using the European Road Placement." /></p>
<p>Now go to the <code>Position</code> tab of the <code>Label Class</code> dialog.  You&rsquo;ll see that there are a different set of options to the dialog for the points feature class.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now make the <code>Waterway</code> layer visible.</li>
<li>This time the <code>name</code> field contains the data we want to use to label the waterways.</li>
<li>Your Waterway layer should already be symbolised as a single symbol and a blue line.</li>
<li>Now go to the Labeling tab of the ribbon and select to label the <code>Waterway</code> layer with the <code>name</code> field and set the font size to <code>5</code>.  You may have to pan and zoom around the map to find labelled waterways.</li>
<li>Waterways are often labelled on maps in the same blue as the features, so on the ribbon set the colour to <code>Yogo Blue</code></li>
<li>In the <code>Label Placement</code> group of the ribbon scroll down the selection box until you find <code>European Streets</code> and click on that</li>
</ul>
<p>This time you should find that the labels are either above or below the line, but not right on it, and are again curved to match the line.</p>
<p><img alt="Labelled streams - the labels are either above or below the line and follow the shape of the stream." src="../images/styles/WaterwayLabels.png" title="Labelled streams - the labels are either above or below the line and follow the shape of the stream." /></p>
<p>Now go to the <code>Position</code> tab of the <code>Label Class</code> dialog and have a look at the settings - this time the labels are <code>Offset curved</code>.  Try changing some of the settings to see how it affects your labels.</p>
<h3 id="using-label-classes">Using label classes</h3>
<p>Label classes refer to the ability to add labels to a subset of features in your feature class, or different labels for different features.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Information" src="../images/svg/info-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Let your map refresh</strong></p>
<p>Note that you&rsquo;ll need to be patient while your map refreshes after each step.  Labelling the map is processor intensive and can take a while.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case it would be good to be able to set the <code>SE_NamePlace</code> layer so that different categories of named place have different label styles.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Have a look at the attribute table for the <code>SE_NamedPlace</code> layer, in particular the <code>CLASSIFICA</code> column.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should see a range of classifications which include <code>Populated Place</code> - we&rsquo;ll set this as a class and label just the populated places.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the Labeling ribbon look in the <code>Label Class</code> group.  This is where you set the Field name to label all of the features.</li>
<li>The <code>Class</code> field should say <code>Class 1</code> at the moment<ul>
<li>Untick the box next to <code>Label Features In This Class</code> - your labels should disappear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Turning off the Named Place labels in the Label Class group of the ribbon.  Label Features in this Class is no longer ticked." src="../images/styles/LabelClass1.png" title="Turning off the Named Place labels in the Label Class group of the ribbon.  Label Features in this Class is no longer ticked." /></p>
<ul>
<li>Drop down the <code>Class</code> choices and select <code>Create new label class</code></li>
<li>Put a class name, such as <code>Populated Place</code> in the dialog that pops up and click <code>OK</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;ll probably find that Arc adds back in all of the Name Place labels without the formatting that you&rsquo;ve already done.  At this stage you need to tell Arc that you only want to label certain features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the SQL<sup id="fnref:402"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:402">2</a></sup> button to the right of the Class drop down - see image below</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The Label Class group set up to label populated places - click on the indicated button to choose the features to label." src="../images/styles/LabelClassPopPlace1.png" title="The Label Class group set up to label populated places - click on the indicated button to choose the features to label." /></p>
<p>This brings up the Label Class pane to the right of the map window.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Label Class pane click on the button for <code>New expression</code></li>
<li>Use the dropdown boxes that appear to select the statement</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="sql">Where CLASSIFICA is equal to Populated Place
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Then click <code>Apply</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Creating the SQL query to display only the populated place labels." src="../images/styles/LabelClassPopPlaceSQL_small.png" title="Creating the SQL query to display only the populated place labels." /></p>
<p>The number of labels on your map should immediately decrease and now all you need to do is style the labels so that they look better</p>
<ul>
<li>decrease the size of the font so that the labels don&rsquo;t dominate your map - remember that the labels need to be visible, but not too large.</li>
<li>change the label position so that it looks good to you</li>
<li>maybe change the colour to something less &ldquo;stark&rdquo; than black, e.g. Grey 80%</li>
<li>Sometimes applying a <code>halo</code> can help a label to stand out against a background<ul>
<li>go to the Symbol tab of the Label pane and drop down the <code>Halo</code> subheading</li>
<li>set the <code>Halo symbol</code> to white</li>
<li>choose a <code>Halo size</code> - it&rsquo;s usually best to keep this narrow, e.g. max of 1 pt, but 0.4 pt can be very effective without being too obvious.</li>
<li>Check the symbol in the pane below then click <code>Apply</code> when you are happy with it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The styled and labelled Vector layers now looking like a &quot;proper&quot; map.  You can play with the settings until you are happy with the map." src="../images/styles/InterimView5_small.png" title="The styled and labelled Vector layers now looking like a &quot;proper&quot; map.  You can play with the settings until you are happy with the map." /></p>
<h3 id="converting-labels-to-annotation">Converting labels to annotation</h3>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ll finish building up the 1:50 000 geological map.</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn the geological layers back on and have a look at your map</li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing you may notice is that the place and contour labels &ldquo;float above&rdquo; the bedrock geology polygons.  Particularly with halos set this looks a bit odd and in this case the labels only need to be in the background.</p>
<p><img alt="Labels &quot;floating&quot; above the bedrock geology - it's particularly clear with the halos." src="../images/styles/LabelsFloating_small.png" title="Labels &quot;floating&quot; above the bedrock geology - it's particularly clear with the halos." /></p>
<p>The best way of dealing with this is to <strong>convert the labels to annotation</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/svg/warning-black-24dp.png" /> <strong>Warning</strong></p>
<p>Before you convert your labels to annotation make sure that they are as you want them to look.  Once you have converted them it will be harder to make changes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Select the <code>SE_NamedPlace</code> layer in the Contents and right-click</li>
<li><code>Convert Labels &gt; Convert Labels to Annotation</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This will open the Geoprocessing pane to the right of your map.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the <code>Conversion Scale</code> is the scale you will be printing your map - in this case <code>1:50,000</code></li>
<li>Check that the <code>Feature Layer</code> is correct</li>
<li>Select the <code>Output Geodatabase</code> as your project geodatabase (i.e. the same one that the original layer is stored in)</li>
<li>Drop down the <code>Extent</code> field and select <code>Default</code></li>
<li>Then click to <code>Run</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The dialog to convert labels to annotation." src="../images/styles/LabelsAnnotation.png" title="The dialog to convert labels to annotation." /></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve run the tool a new group should appear in your contents.  In this case mine is called <code>GroupAnno</code> and inside it is a layer called <code>SE_NamedPlaceAnno</code> - the same name as the original layer with <code>Anno</code> on the end.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now drag and drop this group further down the Contents list so that it appears below the bedrock layer</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done that you should be able to see that the Populated place labels are now in the background of the geological map.</p>
<p><img alt="The Populated Place labels have been converted to annotation and moved down the Contents list.  They now appear in the background rather than on top of the bedrock geology." src="../images/styles/LabelsAnnotationMoved.png" title="The Populated Place labels have been converted to annotation and moved down the Contents list.

<p>To finish the map also convert the labels for the following layers to annotation and move those down the contents list.  You&rsquo;ll need to change the name of the <code>Output Layer</code> each time or you&rsquo;ll overwrite your existing annotations.</p>
<p>SE_Road</p>
<p>Waterway</p>
<p>ContoursT50</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Arc creates annotations it automatically turns off the automatic labelling on the layers.  If you need to bring this back all you need to do is go back to the Labeling ribbon and click the <code>Label</code> button on the left again.</p>
<h2 id="final-map">Final map</h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve finished your map</p>
<ul>
<li>set the scale to 1:50 000</li>
<li>set the background map as the <code>Vector data</code> group and turn off the <code>vmd-raster_3681591</code> layer - I want to be able to give feedback on your work, not the work of the Ordnance Survey!</li>
<li>go to the <code>Share</code> tab of the ribbon and select to Export <code>Map</code></li>
<li>Export as either <code>PNG</code> or <code>PDF</code> and upload the map to your individual area of the Class Notebook as a record of what you have done.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you upload your map during the week after the class you will get brief feedback on what you have done.</p>
<p>Your map could look something like the map below - hopefully rather better!  We won&rsquo;t worry about setting up a full layout at the moment as that is covered in another chapter.</p>
